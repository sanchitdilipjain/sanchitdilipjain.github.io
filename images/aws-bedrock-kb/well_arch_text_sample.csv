Publication date: April 10, 2023 (Document revisions)

The focus of this paper is the security pillar of the AWS Well-Architected Framework. It provides guidance to help you apply best
    practices, current recommendations in the design, delivery, and maintenance of secure AWS
    workloads.

Introduction"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/welcome.html,"Introduction

The AWS Well-Architected
      Framework helps you understand trade-offs for decisions you make while building
      workloads on AWS. By using the Framework, you will learn current architectural best practices
      for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable workloads in the
      cloud. It provides a way for you to consistently measure your workload against best practices
      and identify areas for improvement. We believe that having well-architected workloads greatly
      increases the likelihood of business success.

The framework is based on six pillars:

Operational Excellence

Security

Reliability

Performance Efficiency

Cost Optimization

Sustainability"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/welcome.html,"Sustainability

This paper focuses on the security pillar. This will help you meet your business and
      regulatory requirements by following current AWS recommendations. It’s intended for those in
      technology roles, such as chief technology officers (CTOs), chief information security officers
      (CSOs/CISOs), architects, developers, and operations team members.

After reading this paper, you will understand AWS current recommendations and strategies
      to use when designing cloud architectures with security in mind. This paper doesn’t provide
      implementation details or architectural patterns but does include references to appropriate
      resources for this information. By adopting the practices in this paper, you can build
      architectures that protect your data and systems, control access, and respond automatically to
      security events.

The security pillar describes how to take advantage of cloud technologies to protect data,
    systems, and assets in a way that can improve your security posture. This paper provides
    in-depth, best-practice guidance for architecting secure workloads on AWS.

Design principles

In the cloud, there are a number of principles that can help you strengthen your workload
      security:

Implement a strong identity foundation: Implement the
          principle of least privilege and enforce separation of duties with appropriate
          authorization for each interaction with your AWS resources. Centralize identity
          management, and aim to eliminate reliance on long-term static credentials."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/security.html,"Maintain traceability: Monitor, alert, and audit
          actions and changes to your environment in real time. Integrate log and metric collection
          with systems to automatically investigate and take action.

Apply security at all layers: Apply a defense in
          depth approach with multiple security controls. Apply to all layers (for example, edge of
          network, VPC, load balancing, every instance and compute service, operating system,
          application, and code).

Automate security best practices: Automated
          software-based security mechanisms improve your ability to securely scale more rapidly and
          cost-effectively. Create secure architectures, including the implementation of controls
          that are defined and managed as code in version-controlled templates."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/security.html,"Protect data in transit and at rest: Classify your
          data into sensitivity levels and use mechanisms, such as encryption, tokenization, and
          access control where appropriate.

Keep people away from data: Use mechanisms and tools
          to reduce or eliminate the need for direct access or manual processing of data. This
          reduces the risk of mishandling or modification and human error when handling sensitive
          data.

Prepare for security events: Prepare for an incident
          by having incident management and investigation policy and processes that align to your
          organizational requirements. Run incident response simulations and use tools with
          automation to increase your speed for detection, investigation, and recovery.

      EC2) is categorized as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and, as such, requires the customer
      to perform all of the necessary security configuration and management tasks. Customers that
      deploy an Amazon EC2 instance are responsible for management of the guest operating system

      infrastructure deployed in the AWS environment that may previously have been managed by the
      customer. As every customer is deployed differently in AWS, customers can take advantage of
      shifting management of certain IT controls to AWS, which results in a (new) distributed
      control environment. Customers can then use the AWS control and compliance documentation
      available to them to perform their control evaluation and verification procedures as required.

      to detect and address suspicious and malicious activities from your AWS resources. Unexpected
      or suspicious behaviors from your resources can indicate that your AWS resources have been

AWS internal event monitoring

External security intelligence against AWS network address space

Internet abuse complaints against AWS resources

Although the AWS abuse response team aggressively monitors and shuts down unauthorized
      activity running on AWS, the majority of abuse complaints refer to customers who have
      legitimate business on AWS. Some examples of common causes of unintentional abuse activities
      include:

Compromised resource – An unpatched Amazon EC2
          instance could be infected and become a botnet agent.

Unintentional abuse – An overly aggressive web
          crawler might be classified as a denial-of-service attack by some internet sites.

Secondary abuse – An end user of the service provided
          by an AWS customer might post malware files on a public Amazon S3 bucket."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/abuse-and-compromise.html,"False complaints – Sometimes internet users

AWS is committed to working with AWS customers to prevent, detect, and mitigate abuse,
      and to defend against future recurrences. We encourage you to review the AWS Acceptable Use Policy, which describes prohibited
      uses of the web services offered by Amazon Web Services and its affiliates. To support timely
      response to abuse notifications from AWS, make sure that your AWS account contact information
      is accurate. When you receive an AWS abuse warning, your security and operational staff should
      immediately investigate the matter. A delay can prolong the reputation impact and legal

Security governance, as a subset of the overall approach, is meant to support
        business objectives by defining policies and control objectives to help manage risk. Achieve
        risk management by following a layered approach to security control objectives–each layer
        builds upon the previous one. Understanding the AWS Shared Responsibility Model is your
        foundational layer. This knowledge provides clarity on what you are responsible for on the
        customer side and what you inherit from AWS. A beneficial resource is AWS Artifact, which gives you on-demand
        access to AWS’ security and compliance reports and select online agreements."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/governance.html,"Meet most of your control objectives at the next layer. This is where the
        platform-wide capability lives. For example, this layer includes the AWS account vending
        process, integration with an identity provider such as AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On), and the
        common detective controls. Some of the output of the platform governance process is here
        too. When you want to start using a new AWS service, update service control policies (SCPs)
        in the AWS Organizations service to provide the guardrails for initial use of the service.
        You can use other SCPs to implement common security control objectives, often referred to as
        security invariants. These are control objectives or configuration that you apply to
        multiple accounts, organization units, or the whole AWS organization. Typical examples are
        limiting the Regions that infrastructure runs in or preventing the deactivation of detective"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/governance.html,"controls. This middle layer also contains codified policies such as config rules or checks
        in pipelines."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/governance.html,"The top layer is where the product teams meet control objectives.
        This is because the implementation is done in the applications that the product teams
        control. This could be implementing input validation in an application or ensuring that
        identity passes between microservices correctly. Even though the product team owns the
        configuration, they can still inherit some capability from the middle
        layer."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/governance.html,"Wherever you implement the control, the goal is the same: manage risk. A
        range of risk management frameworks apply to specific industries, regions, or technologies.
        Your main objective: highlight the risk based on likelihood and consequence. This is the
          inherent risk. You can then define a control objective
        that reduces either the likelihood, consequence, or both. Then, with a control in place, you
        can see what the resulting risk is likely to be. This is the residual risk. Control objectives can apply to one or many workloads. The
        following diagram shows a typical risk matrix. The likelihood is based on frequency of
        previous occurrences and the consequence is based on the financial, reputational and time
        cost of the event.

We recommend that you organize workloads in separate accounts and group accounts based on
      function, compliance requirements, or a common set of controls rather than mirroring your
      organization’s reporting structure. In AWS, accounts are a hard boundary. For example,
      account-level separation is strongly recommended for isolating production workloads from
      development and test workloads."

      they are created. When you create an account through AWS Organizations, it is important to consider the
      email address you use, as this will be the root user that allows the password to be reset.
      Organizations allows you to group accounts into organizational units (OUs), which can represent different environments based on the
      workload’s requirements and purpose."

      AWS Organizations allows you to use service control policies (SCPs) to apply permission guardrails at
      the organization, organizational unit, or account level, which apply to all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users and roles. For example, you can apply an
      SCP that restricts users from launching resources in Regions that you have not explicitly
      allowed. AWS Control Tower offers a simplified way to set up and govern multiple accounts. It

PDF

RSS

Establish common guardrails and isolation between environments
      (such as production, development, and test) and workloads through
      a multi-account strategy. Account-level separation is strongly
      recommended, as it provides a strong isolation boundary for
      security, billing, and access.

Desired outcome: An account structure that isolates cloud
    operations, unrelated workloads, and environments into separate accounts, increasing security
    across the cloud infrastructure.

Common anti-patterns:

Placing multiple unrelated workloads with different data sensitivity levels into the
        same account.

Poorly defined organizational unit (OU) structure.

Benefits of establishing this best practice:

Decreased scope of impact if a workload is inadvertently accessed."

Automated account creation and maintenance process.

Centralized auditing of your infrastructure for compliance and regulatory

Implementation guidance

AWS accounts provide a security isolation boundary between
      workloads or resources that operate at different sensitivity
      levels. AWS provides tools to manage your cloud workloads at
      scale through a multi-account strategy to leverage this
      isolation boundary. For guidance on the concepts, patterns,
      and implementation of a multi-account strategy on AWS, see
      Organizing
        Your AWS Environment Using Multiple Accounts."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_securely_operate_multi_accounts.html,"When you have multiple AWS accounts under central management,
      your accounts should be organized into a hierarchy defined by
      layers of organizational units (OUs). Security controls can
      then be organized and applied to the OUs and member accounts,
      establishing consistent preventative controls on member
      accounts in the organization. The security controls are
      inherited, allowing you to filter permissions available to
      member accounts located at lower levels of an OU hierarchy. A
      good design takes advantage of this inheritance to reduce the
      number and complexity of security policies required to achieve
      the desired security controls for each member account."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_securely_operate_multi_accounts.html,"AWS Organizations and
      AWS Control Tower are two services that you can use to
      implement and manage this multi-account structure in your AWS

      into a hierarchy defined by one or more layers of OUs, with
      each OU containing a number of member accounts.
      Service
        control policies (SCPs) allow the organization
      administrator to establish granular preventative controls on
      member accounts, and
      AWS Config can be used to establish proactive and detective
      controls on member accounts. Many AWS services

          admitted into the organization.

Optional controls that can be turned on or off for a given set of OUs.

Design an organizational unit
            structure: A properly designed organizational
          unit structure reduces the management burden required to
          create and maintain service control policies and other
          security controls. Your organizational unit structure should
          be
          aligned
            with your business needs, data sensitivity, and workload
            structure.

Create a landing zone for your
            multi-account environment: A landing zone
          provides a consistent security and infrastructure foundation
          from which your organization can quickly develop, launch,
          and deploy workloads. You can use a
          custom-built
            landing zone or AWS Control Tower to orchestrate your
          environment."

          and
          optional
          controls that can be deployed. Mandatory controls are
          automatically deployed when implementing Control Tower.
          Review the list of highly recommended and optional controls,
          and implement controls that are appropriate to your needs.

Restrict access to newly added

          as users and roles are only propagated to the Regions that
          you specify. This action can be performed through the

SEC01-BP02 Secure account root user and properties

PDF

RSS

The root user is the most privileged user in an AWS account, with
    full administrative access to all resources within the account, and
    in some cases cannot be constrained by security policies. Deactivating
    programmatic access to the root user, establishing appropriate
    controls for the root user, and avoiding routine use of the root
    user helps reduce the risk of inadvertent exposure of the root
    credentials and subsequent compromise of the cloud environment.

Desired outcome: Securing the root user helps reduce the
    chance that accidental or intentional damage can occur through the misuse of root user
    credentials. Establishing detective controls can also alert the appropriate personnel when
    actions are taken using the root user.

Common anti-patterns:"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_securely_operate_aws_account.html,"Using the root user for tasks other than the few that require root user credentials.

Neglecting to test contingency plans on a regular basis to verify the functioning of
        critical infrastructure, processes, and personnel during an emergency.

Only considering the typical account login flow and neglecting to consider or test
        alternate account recovery methods.

Not handling DNS, email servers, and telephone providers as part of the critical
        security perimeter, as these are used in the account recovery flow.

Benefits of establishing this best practice: Securing access to
    the root user builds confidence that actions in your account are controlled and audited.

Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:
    High

Implementation guidance"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_securely_operate_aws_account.html,"AWS offers many tools to help secure your account. However,
      because some of these measures are not turned on by default, you
      must take direct action to implement them. Consider these
      recommendations as foundational steps to securing your AWS account. As you implement these steps it’s important that you
      build a process to continuously assess and monitor the security
      controls."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_securely_operate_aws_account.html,"When you first create an AWS account, you begin with one identity
      that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the
      account. This identity is called the AWS account root user. You
      can sign in as the root user using the email address and password
      that you used to create the account. Due to the elevated access
      granted to the AWS root user, you must limit use of the AWS root
      user to perform tasks that
      specifically
      require it. The root user login credentials must be closely
      guarded, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) should always be
      used for the AWS account root user."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_securely_operate_aws_account.html,"In addition to the normal authentication flow to log into your
      root user using a username, password, and multi-factor
      authentication (MFA) device, there are account recovery flows to
      log into your AWS account root user given access to the email
      address and phone number associated with your account. Therefore,
      it is equally important to secure the root user email account
      where the recovery email is sent and the phone number associated
      with the account. Also consider potential circular dependencies
      where the email address associated with the root user is hosted on
      email servers or domain name service (DNS) resources from the same
      AWS account."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_securely_operate_aws_account.html,"When using AWS Organizations, there are multiple AWS accounts each
      of which have a root user. One account is designated as the
      management account and several layers of member accounts can then
      be added underneath the management account. Prioritize securing
      your management account’s root user, then address your member
      account root users. The strategy for securing your management
      account’s root user can differ from your member account root
      users, and you can place preventative security controls on your
      member account root users.

Implementation steps

The following implementation steps are recommended to establish controls for the root
        user. Where applicable, recommendations are cross-referenced to CIS AWS
          Foundations benchmark version 1.4.0. In addition to these steps, consult AWS best
          practice guidelines for securing your AWS account and resources.

Preventative controls"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_securely_operate_aws_account.html,"Set up accurate contact
              information for the account. 
          
             
             
             
          
               This information is used for the lost password recovery flow, lost MFA device
                account recovery flow, and for critical security-related communications with your
                team. 
            
               Use an email address hosted by your corporate domain, preferably a distribution
                list, as the root user’s email address. Using a distribution list rather than an
                individual’s email account provides additional redundancy and continuity for access
                to the root account over long periods of time. 
            
               The phone number listed on the contact information should be a dedicated,
                secure phone for this purpose. The phone number should not be listed or shared with
                anyone."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_securely_operate_aws_account.html,"Do not create access keys for the root user. If access keys exist, remove them (CIS

               Credential management best practices depend on your regulatory and policy

               Verify that the organization, and not a single individual, maintains control
                over the phone number and email alias associated with the account (which are used
                for password reset and MFA reset flow)."

                ones. Only log in as the root user to perform AWS tasks that require
                  root user. All other actions should be performed by other users assuming
                appropriate roles.

Periodically check that access to the root user is functioning so that procedures

Operating your workloads securely

PDF

RSS

Operating workloads securely covers the whole lifecycle of a workload from design, to
      build, to run, and to ongoing improvement. One of the ways to improve your ability to operate
      securely in the cloud is by taking an organizational approach to governance. Governance is the
      way that decisions are guided consistently without depending solely on the good judgment of
      the people involved. Your governance model and process are the way you answer the question
      “How do I know that the control objectives for a given workload are met and are appropriate
      for that workload?” Having a consistent approach to making decisions speeds up the deployment
      of workloads and helps raise the bar for the security capability in your organization."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/operating-your-workload-securely.html,"To operate your workload securely, you must apply overarching best practices to every area
      of security. Take requirements and processes that you have defined in operational excellence
      at an organizational and workload level, and apply them to all areas. Staying up to date with
      AWS and industry recommendations and threat intelligence helps you evolve your threat model
      and control objectives. Automating security processes, testing, and validation help you scale
      your security operations."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/operating-your-workload-securely.html,"Automation allows consistency and repeatability of processes. People are good at many
      things, but consistently doing the same thing repeatedly without mistakes is not one of them.
      Even with well-written runbooks, you run the risk that people won’t consistently carry out
      repetitive tasks. This is especially true when people have diverse responsibilities and then
      have to respond to unfamiliar alerts. Automation, however, responds the same way
      each time. The best way to deploy applications is through automation. The code that runs the
      deployment can be tested and then used to perform the deployment. This increases confidence in
      the change process and reduces the risk of a failed change."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/operating-your-workload-securely.html,"To verify that the configuration meets your control objectives, test the automation and
      the deployed application in a non-production environment first. This way, you can test the
      automation to prove that it performed all the steps correctly. You also get early feedback in
      the development and deployment cycle, reducing rework. To reduce the chance of deployment
      errors, make configuration changes by code not by people. If you need to re-deploy an
      application, automation makes this much easier. As you define additional control objectives,
      you can easily add them to the automation for all workloads."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/operating-your-workload-securely.html,"Instead of having individual workload owners invest in security specific to their
      workloads, save time by using common capabilities and shared components. Some examples of
      services that multiple teams can consume include the AWS account creation process, centralized
      identity for people, common logging configuration, and AMI and container base image creation.
      This approach can help builders improve workload cycle times and consistently meet security
      control objectives. When teams are more consistent, you can validate control objectives and
      better report your control posture and risk position to stakeholders.

    machine images and infrastructure-as-code templates for security
    vulnerabilities, irregularities, and drift from an established

Perform threat modeling to identify and maintain an up-to-date register of potential threats and associated mitigations for your workload. Prioritize your threats and adapt your security control mitigations to prevent, detect, and respond. Revisit and maintain this in the context of your workload, and the evolving security landscape.

Level of risk exposed if this best practice
    is not established: High

Implementation guidance

What is threat modeling?

As a definition, “Threat modeling works to identify, communicate, and understand threats and mitigations within the context of protecting something of value.” – The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Application Threat Modeling

Why should you threat model?"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_securely_operate_threat_model.html,"Systems are complex, and are becoming increasingly more complex and capable over time, delivering more business value and increased customer satisfaction and engagement. This means that IT design decisions need to account for an ever-increasing number of use cases. This complexity and number of use-case permutations typically makes unstructured approaches ineffective for finding and mitigating threats. Instead, you need a systematic approach to enumerate the potential threats to the system, and to devise mitigations and prioritize these mitigations to make sure that the limited resources of your organization have the maximum impact in improving the overall security posture of the system."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_securely_operate_threat_model.html,"Threat modeling is designed to provide this systematic approach, with the aim of finding and addressing issues early in the design process, when the mitigations have a low relative cost and effort compared to later in the lifecycle. This approach aligns with the industry principle of “shift-left” security. Ultimately, threat modeling integrates with an organization’s risk management process and helps drive decisions on which controls to implement by using a threat driven approach.

When should threat modeling be performed?"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_securely_operate_threat_model.html,"Start threat modeling as early as possible in the lifecycle of your workload, this gives you better flexibility on what to do with the threats you have identified. Much like software bugs, the earlier you identify threats, the more cost effective it is to address them. A threat model is a living document and should continue to evolve as your workloads change. Revisit your threat models over time, including when there is a major change, a change in the threat landscape, or when you adopt a new feature or service.

Implementation steps

How can we perform threat modeling?

There are many different ways to perform threat modeling. Much like programming languages, there are advantages and disadvantages to each, and you should choose the way that works best for you. One approach is to start with Shostack’s 4 Question Frame for Threat Modeling, which poses open-ended questions to provide structure to your threat modeling exercise:"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_securely_operate_threat_model.html,"What are working on?
        
        
          The purpose of this question is to help you understand and agree upon the system you are building and the details about that system that are relevant to security. Creating a model or diagram is the most popular way to answer this question, as it helps you to visualize what you are building, for example, using a data flow diagram. Writing down assumptions and important details about your system also helps you define what is in scope. This allows everyone contributing to the threat model to focus on the same thing, and avoid time-consuming detours into out-of-scope topics (including out of date versions of your system). For example, if you are building a web application, it is probably not worth your time threat modeling the operating system trusted boot sequence for browser clients, as you have no ability to affect this with your design."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_securely_operate_threat_model.html,"What can go wrong?
        
        
          This is where you identify threats to your system. Threats are accidental or intentional actions or events that have unwanted impacts and could affect the security of your system. Without a clear understanding of what could go wrong, you have no way of doing anything about it."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_securely_operate_threat_model.html,"There is no canonical list of what can go wrong. Creating this list requires brainstorming and collaboration between all of the individuals within your team and relevant personas involved in the threat modeling exercise. You can aid your brainstorming by using a model for identifying threats, such as STRIDE, which suggests different categories to evaluate: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of privilege. In addition, you might want to aid the brainstorming by reviewing existing lists and research for inspiration, including the OWASP Top 10, HiTrust Threat Catalog, and your organization’s own threat catalog."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_securely_operate_threat_model.html,"What are we going to do about it?
        
        
          As was the case with the previous question, there is no canonical list of all possible mitigations. The inputs into this step are the identified threats, actors, and areas of improvement from the previous step. 
        
        
          Security and compliance is a shared responsibility between you and AWS. It’s important to understand that when you ask “What are we going to do about it?”, that you are also asking “Who is responsible for doing something about it?”. Understanding the balance of responsibilities between you and AWS helps you scope your threat modeling exercise to the mitigations that are under your control, which are typically a combination of AWS service configuration options and your own system-specific mitigations."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_securely_operate_threat_model.html,"For the AWS portion of the shared responsibility, you will find that AWS services are in-scope of many compliance programs. These programs help you to understand the robust controls in place at AWS to maintain security and compliance of the cloud. The audit reports from these programs are available for download for AWS customers from AWS Artifact."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_securely_operate_threat_model.html,"Regardless of which AWS services you are using, there’s always an element of customer responsibility, and mitigations aligned to these responsibilities should be included in your threat model. For security control mitigations for the AWS services themselves, you want to consider implementing security controls across domains, including domains such as identity and access management (authentication and authorization), data protection (at rest and in transit), infrastructure security, logging, and monitoring. The documentation for each AWS service has a dedicated security chapter that provides guidance on the security controls to consider as mitigations. Importantly, consider the code that you are writing and its code dependencies, and think about the controls that you could put in place to address those threats. These controls could be things such as input validation, session handling, and  bounds handling. Often, the majority of vulnerabilities are introduced in custom code,"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_securely_operate_threat_model.html,"in custom code, so focus on this area."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_securely_operate_threat_model.html,"Did we do a good job?
        
        
          The aim is for your team and organization to improve both the quality of threat models and the velocity at which you are performing threat modeling over time. These improvements come from a combination of practice, learning, teaching, and reviewing. To go deeper and get hands on, it’s recommended that you and your team complete the Threat modeling the right way for builders training course or workshop. In addition, if you are looking for guidance on how to integrate threat modeling into your organization’s application development lifecycle, see How to approach threat modeling post on the AWS Security Blog.

To use AWS services, you must grant your users and applications access to resources
    in your AWS accounts. As you run more workloads on AWS, you need robust identity management and
    permissions in place to ensure that the right people have access to the right resources under
    the right conditions. AWS offers a large selection of capabilities to help you manage your human
    and machine identities and their permissions. The best practices for these capabilities fall
    into two main areas.

There are two types of identities you need to manage when approaching operating secure AWS
      workloads.

Human identities: The administrators, developers,
          operators, and consumers of your applications require an identity to access your AWS
          environments and applications. These can be members of your organization, or external
          users with whom you collaborate, and who interact with your AWS resources via a web
          browser, client application, mobile app, or interactive command-line tools."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/identity-management.html,"Machine identities: Your workload applications,
          operational tools, and components require an identity to make requests to AWS services,
          for example, to read data. These identities include machines running in your AWS
          environment, such as Amazon EC2 instances or AWS Lambda functions. You can also manage machine
          identities for external parties who need access. Additionally, you might also have
          machines outside of AWS that need access to your AWS environment.

Sign-ins (authentication using sign-in credentials) can present risks when not using mechanisms like multi-factor authentication (MFA), especially in situations where sign-in credentials have been inadvertently disclosed or are easily guessed. Use strong sign-in mechanisms to reduce these risks by requiring MFA and strong password policies.

Desired outcome: Reduce the risks of unintended access to credentials in AWS by using strong sign-in mechanisms for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users, the AWS account root user, AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) (successor to AWS Single Sign-On), and third-party identity providers. This means requiring MFA, enforcing strong password policies, and detecting anomalous login behavior.

Common anti-patterns:"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_enforce_mechanisms.html,"Not enforcing a strong password policy for your identities including complex passwords and MFA.

Sharing the same credentials among different users.

Not using detective controls for suspicious sign-ins.

Level of risk exposed if this best practice
    is not established: High

Implementation guidance

There are many ways for human identities to sign-in to AWS. It is an AWS best practice to rely on a centralized identity provider using federation (direct federation or using AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On)) when authenticating to AWS. In that case, you should establish a secure sign-in process with your identity provider or Microsoft Active Directory."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_enforce_mechanisms.html,"When you first open an AWS account, you begin with an AWS account root user. You should only use the account root user to set up access for your users (and for tasks that require the root user). It’s important to turn on MFA for the account root user immediately after opening your AWS account and to secure the root user using the AWS best practice guide.

If you create users in AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On), then secure the sign-in process in that service. For consumer identities, you can use Amazon Cognito user pools and secure the sign-in process in that service, or by using one of the identity providers that Amazon Cognito user pools supports.

If you are using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users, you would secure the sign-in process using IAM.

Regardless of the sign-in method, it’s critical to enforce a strong sign-in policy.

Implementation steps"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_enforce_mechanisms.html,"Implementation steps

The following are general strong sign-in recommendations. The actual settings you configure should be set by your company policy or use a standard like NIST 800-63.

Require MFA. It’s an IAM best practice to require MFA for human identities and workloads. Turning on MFA provides an additional layer of security requiring that users provide sign-in credentials and a one-time password (OTP) or a cryptographically verified and generated string from a hardware device.

Enforce a minimum password length, which is a primary factor in password strength.

Enforce password complexity to make passwords more difficult to guess.

Allow users to change their own passwords.

Create individual identities instead of shared credentials. By creating individual identities, you can give each user a unique set of security credentials. Individual users provide the ability to audit each user’s activity.

IAM Identity Center recommendations:"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_enforce_mechanisms.html,"IAM Identity Center provides a predefined password policy when using the default directory that establishes password length, complexity, and reuse requirements.

Turn on MFA and configure the context-aware or always-on setting for MFA when the identity source is the default directory, AWS Managed Microsoft AD, or AD Connector.

Allow users to register their own MFA devices.

Amazon Cognito user pools directory recommendations:

Configure the Password strength settings.

Require MFA for users.

Use the Amazon Cognito user pools advanced security settings for features like adaptive authentication which can block suspicious sign-ins.

IAM user recommendations:

Ideally you are using IAM Identity Center or direct federation. However, you might have the need for IAM users. In that case, set a password policy for IAM users. You can use the password policy to define requirements such as minimum length or whether the password requires non-alphabetic characters."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_enforce_mechanisms.html,"Create an IAM policy to enforce MFA sign-in so that users are allowed to manage their own passwords and MFA devices.

SEC02-BP02 Use temporary credentials

PDF

RSS

When doing any type of authentication, it’s best to use temporary
    credentials instead of long-term credentials to reduce or eliminate
    risks, such as credentials being inadvertently disclosed, shared, or
    stolen.

Desired outcome: To reduce the risk of long-term
    credentials, use temporary credentials wherever possible for both human and machine identities.
    Long-term credentials create many risks, for example, they can be uploaded in code to public
    GitHub repositories. By using temporary credentials, you significantly reduce the chances of
    credentials becoming compromised.

Common anti-patterns:

Developers using long-term access keys from IAM users rather than obtaining temporary
        credentials from the CLI using federation."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_unique.html,"Developers embedding long-term access keys in their code and uploading that code to
        public Git repositories.

Developers embedding long-term access keys in mobile apps that are then made available
        in app stores.

Users sharing long-term access keys with other users, or employees leaving the company
        with long-term access keys still in their possession.

Using long-term access keys for machine identities when temporary credentials could be
        used.

Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:
    High

Implementation guidance"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_unique.html,"Use temporary security credentials instead of long-term
      credentials for all AWS API and CLI requests. API and CLI requests
      to AWS services must, in nearly every case, be signed using
      AWS       access keys. These requests can be signed with either
      temporary or long-term credentials. The only time you should use
      long-term credentials, also known as long-term access keys, is if
      you are using an
      IAM
      user or the
      AWS account root user. When you federate to AWS or assume an
      IAM
      role through other methods, temporary credentials are
      generated. Even when you access the AWS Management Console using
      sign-in credentials, temporary credentials are generated for you
      to make calls to AWS services. There are few situations where you
      need long-term credentials and you can accomplish nearly all tasks
      using temporary credentials."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_unique.html,"Avoiding the use of long-term credentials in favor of temporary
      credentials should go hand in hand with a strategy of reducing the
      usage of IAM users in favor of federation and IAM roles. While IAM
      users have been used for both human and machine identities in the
      past, we now recommend not using them to avoid the risks in using
      long-term access keys.

Implementation steps

For human identities like employees, administrators, developers,
        operators, and customers:"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_unique.html,"You should
            rely
            on a centralized identity provider and
            require
            human users to use federation with an identity provider to
            access AWS using temporary credentials.
            Federation for your users can be done either
            with direct
            federation to each AWS account or
            using AWS             IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On)) and the identity provider of your
            choice. Federation provides a number of advantages over
            using IAM users in addition to eliminating long-term
            credentials. Your users can also request temporary
            credentials from the command line for
            direct
            federation or by using
            IAM Identity Center. This means that there are
            few uses cases that require IAM users or long-term
            credentials for your users."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_unique.html,"When granting third parties, such as software as a service
            (SaaS) providers, access to resources in your AWS account,
            you can use
            cross-account
            roles and
            resource-based
            policies.

If you need to grant applications for consumers or customers
            access to your AWS resources, you can
            use Amazon Cognito identity pools or
            Amazon Cognito user pools to provide temporary credentials.
            The permissions for the credentials are configured through
            IAM roles. You can also define a separate IAM role with
            limited permissions for guest users who are not
            authenticated.

For machine identities, you might need to use long-term
        credentials. In these cases, you should
        require
        workloads to use temporary credentials with IAM roles to access
        AWS."

AWS Lambda allows you to configure a

SEC02-BP03 Store and use secrets securely

PDF

RSS

A workload requires an automated capability to prove its identity to
    databases, resources, and third-party services. This is accomplished
    using secret access credentials, such as API access keys, passwords,
    and OAuth tokens. Using a purpose-built service to store, manage,
    and rotate these credentials helps reduce the likelihood that those
    credentials become compromised.

Desired outcome: Implementing a mechanism for securely
    managing application credentials that achieves the following goals:

Identifying what secrets are required for the workload.

Reducing the number of long-term credentials required by replacing them with short-term
        credentials when possible.

Establishing secure storage and automated rotation of remaining long-term credentials."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_secrets.html,"Auditing access to secrets that exist in the workload.

Continual monitoring to verify that no secrets are embedded in source code during the
        development process.

Reduce the likelihood of credentials being inadvertently disclosed.

Common anti-patterns:

Not rotating credentials.

Storing long-term credentials in source code or configuration files.

Storing credentials at rest unencrypted.

Benefits of establishing this best practice:

Secrets are stored encrypted at rest and in transit.

Access to credentials is gated through an API (think of it as a credential
          vending machine).

Access to a credential (both read and write) is audited and logged.

Separation of concerns: credential rotation is performed by a separate component, which
        can be segregated from the rest of the architecture.

Secrets are automatically distributed on-demand to software components and rotation
        occurs in a central location."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_secrets.html,"Access to credentials can be controlled in a fine-grained manner.

Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:
    High

Implementation guidance

In the past, credentials used to authenticate to databases,
      third-party APIs, tokens, and other secrets might have been
      embedded in source code or in environment files. AWS provides
      several mechanisms to store these credentials securely,
      automatically rotate them, and audit their usage.

The best way to approach secrets management is to follow the
      guidance of remove, replace, and rotate. The most secure
      credential is one that you do not have to store, manage, or
      handle. There might be credentials that are no longer necessary to
      the functioning of the workload that can be safely removed."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_secrets.html,"For credentials that are still required for the proper functioning
      of the workload, there might be an opportunity to replace a
      long-term credential with a temporary or short-term credential.
      For example, instead of hard-coding an AWS secret access key,
      consider replacing that long-term credential with a temporary
      credential using IAM roles.

Some long-lived secrets might not be able to be removed or
      replaced. These secrets can be stored in a service such as
      AWS Secrets Manager, where they can be centrally stored,
      managed, and rotated on a regular basis.

An audit of the workload’s source code and configuration files can
      reveal many types of credentials. The following table summarizes
      strategies for handling common types of credentials:

IAM access keys

              parties that require access to resources in your AWS account, ask if they support

AWS               cross-account access. For mobile apps, consider
              using temporary credentials through

Amazon Cognito identity pools (federated identities). For

SEC02-BP04 Rely on a centralized identity provider

PDF

RSS

For workforce identities, rely on an identity provider that allows you to manage
    identities in a centralized place. This makes it easier to manage access across
    multiple applications and services, because you are creating, managing, and
    revoking access from a single location. For example, if someone leaves your
    organization, you can revoke access for all applications and services (including
    AWS) from one location. This reduces the need for multiple credentials and provides
    an opportunity to integrate with existing human resources (HR) processes."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_identity_provider.html,"For federation with individual AWS accounts, you can use centralized identities for AWS
    with a SAML 2.0-based provider with AWS Identity and Access Management. You can use any provider— whether hosted by you
    in AWS, external to AWS, or supplied by the AWS Partner—that is compatible with the SAML 2.0
    protocol. You can use federation between your AWS account and your chosen provider to grant a
    user or application access to call AWS API operations by using a SAML assertion to get
    temporary security credentials. Web-based single sign-on is also supported, allowing users to
    sign in to the AWS Management Console from your sign in website."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_identity_provider.html,"For federation to multiple accounts in your AWS Organizations, you can configure your identity source
    in AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) (IAM Identity Center), and specify
    where your users and groups are stored. Once configured, your identity provider is your source
    of truth, and information can be synchronized using
    the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) v2.0 protocol. You can then look up users
    or groups and grant them IAM Identity Center access to AWS accounts, cloud applications, or both."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_identity_provider.html,"IAM Identity Center integrates with AWS Organizations, which allows you to configure your identity provider once
    and then grant access to existing and new accounts managed in your organization. IAM Identity Center
    provides you with a default store, which you can use to manage your users and groups. If you
    choose to use the IAM Identity Center store, create your users and groups and assign their level of access to
    your AWS accounts and applications, keeping in mind the best practice of least privilege.
    Alternatively, you can choose to Connect to Your External Identity Provider using SAML 2.0, or Connect to Your Microsoft AD Directory using AWS Directory Service. Once configured,
    you can sign into the AWS Management Console, or the AWS mobile app, by authenticating through your central
    identity provider."

Audit and rotate credentials periodically to limit how long the credentials can be used to access your resources. Long-term credentials create many risks, and these risks can be reduced by rotating long-term credentials regularly.

Desired outcome: Implement credential rotation to help reduce the risks associated with long-term credential usage. Regularly audit and remediate non-compliance with credential rotation policies.

Common anti-patterns:

Not auditing credential use.

Using long-term credentials unnecessarily.

Using long-term credentials and not rotating them regularly.

Level of risk exposed if this best practice
    is not established: Medium

Implementation guidance"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_audit.html,"When you cannot rely on temporary credentials and require long-term credentials, audit credentials to verify that defined controls like multi-factor authentication (MFA) are enforced, rotated regularly, and have the appropriate access level.

Periodic validation, preferably through an automated tool, is necessary to verify that the correct controls are enforced. For human identities, you should require users to change their passwords periodically and retire access keys in favor of temporary credentials. As you move from AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to centralized identities, you can generate a credential report to audit your users."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_audit.html,"We also recommend that you enforce and monitor MFA in your identity provider. You can set up AWS Config Rules, or use AWS Security Hub Security Standards, to monitor if users have configured MFA. Consider using IAM Roles Anywhere to provide temporary credentials for machine identities. In situations when using IAM roles and temporary credentials is not possible, frequent auditing and rotating access keys is necessary.

Implementation steps"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_audit.html,"Regularly audit credentials: Auditing the identities that are configured in your identity provider and IAM helps verify that only authorized identities have access to your workload. Such identities can include, but are not limited to, IAM users, AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) users, Active Directory users, or users in a different upstream identity provider. For example, remove people that leave the organization, and remove cross-account roles that are no longer required. Have a process in place to periodically audit permissions to the services accessed by an IAM entity. This helps you identify the policies you need to modify to remove any unused permissions. Use credential reports and AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer to audit IAM credentials and permissions. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to set up alarms for specific API calls called within your AWS environment. Amazon GuardDuty can also alert you to unexpected activity, which might indicate"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_audit.html,which might indicate overly permissive access or unintended access to IAM credentials.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_audit.html,"Rotate credentials regularly: When you are unable to use temporary credentials, rotate long-term IAM access keys regularly (maximum every 90 days). If an access key is unintentionally disclosed without your knowledge, this limits how long the credentials can be used to access your resources. For information about rotating access keys for IAM users, see Rotating access keys.

Review IAM permissions: To improve the security of your AWS account, regularly review and monitor each of your IAM policies. Verify that policies adhere to the principle of least privilege.

Consider automating IAM resource creation and updates: IAM Identity Center automates many IAM tasks, such as role and policy management. Alternatively, AWS CloudFormation can be used to automate the deployment of IAM resources, including roles and policies, to reduce the chance of human error because the templates can be verified and version controlled."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_identities_audit.html,"Use IAM Roles Anywhere to replace IAM users for machine identities: IAM Roles Anywhere allows you to use roles in areas that you traditionally could not, such as on-premise servers. IAM Roles Anywhere uses a trusted X.509 certificate to authenticate to AWS and receive temporary credentials. Using IAM Roles Anywhere avoids the need to rotate these credentials, as long-term credentials are no longer stored in your on-premises environment. Please note that you will need to monitor and rotate the X.509 certificate as it approaches expiration.

PDF

As the number of users you manage grows, you will need to determine ways to organize them
    so that you can manage them at scale. Place users with common security requirements in groups
    defined by your identity provider, and put mechanisms in place to ensure that user attributes
    that may be used for access control (for example, department or location) are correct and
    updated. Use these groups and attributes to control access, rather than individual users. This
    allows you to manage access centrally by changing a user’s group membership or attributes once
    with a permission set, rather than updating many individual policies when a user’s access
    needs change."

Permissions management

PDF

RSS

Manage permissions to control access to human and machine identities that require access
      to AWS and your workloads. Permissions control who can access what, and under what conditions.
      Set permissions to specific human and machine identities to grant access to specific service
      actions on specific resources. Additionally, specify conditions that must be true for access
      to be granted. For example, you can allow developers to create new Lambda functions, but only
      in a specific Region. When managing your AWS environments at scale, adhere to the following
      best practices to ensure that identities only have the access they need and nothing
      more.

There are a number of ways to grant access to different types of resources. One way is
        by using different policy types."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/permissions-management.html,"Identity-based policies in IAM are managed or
        inline, and attach to IAM identities, including users,
      groups, or roles. These policies let you specify what that identity can do (its permissions).
      Identity-based policies can be further categorized.

Managed policies – Standalone identity-based policies
      that you can attach to multiple users, groups, and roles in your AWS account. There are two
      types of managed policies:

AWS-managed policies – Managed policies that are
          created and managed by AWS.

Customer-managed policies – Managed policies that you
          create and manage in your AWS account. Customer-managed policies provide more precise
          control over your policies than AWS-managed policies."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/permissions-management.html,"Managed polices are the preferred method for applying permissions. However, you also can
      use inline policies that you add directly to a single user, group, or role. Inline policies
      maintain a strict one-to-one relationship between a policy and an identity. Inline policies
      are deleted when you delete the identity.

In most cases, you should create your own customer-managed policies following the
      principle of least privilege.

Resource-based policies are attached to a resource. For example, an S3 bucket
        policy is a resource-based policy. These policies grant permission to a principal that can
        be in the same account as the resource or in another account. For a list of services that
        support resource-based policies, see AWS services that work with IAM."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/permissions-management.html,"Permissions boundaries use a managed policy to set the maximum permissions that an
      administrator can set. This allows you to delegate the ability to create and manage
      permissions to developers, such as the creation of an IAM role, but limit the permissions they
      can grant so that they cannot escalate their permission using what they have created."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/permissions-management.html,"Attribute-based
          access control (ABAC) allows you to grant permissions based on attributes. In
        AWS, these are called tags. Tags can be attached to IAM principals (users or roles) and to
        AWS resources. Using IAM policies, administrators can create a reusable policy that applies
        permissions based on the attributes of the IAM principal. For example, as an administrator
        you can use a single IAM policy that grants developers in your organization access to AWS
        resources that match the developers’ project tags. As the team of developers adds resources
        to projects, permissions are automatically applied based on attributes. As a result, no
        policy update is required for each new resource."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/permissions-management.html,"Organizations service control policies (SCP) define the maximum permissions for
        account members of an organization or organizational unit (OU). SCPs limit permissions that identity-based policies or resource-based policies
        grant to entities (users or roles) within the account, but do
          not grant permissions.

Session policies assume a role or a federated user. Pass session policies when
        using the AWS CLI or AWS API Session policies to limit the permissions that the role or
        user's identity-based policies grant to the session. These policies limit permissions for a created session, but do not
          grant permissions. For more information, see Session Policies.

Each component or resource of your workload needs to be accessed by administrators, end
    users, or other components. Have a clear definition of who or what should have access to each
    component, choose the appropriate identity type and method of authentication and
    authorization.

Hard-coding or storing secrets in your application.

Granting custom permissions for each user.

Using long-lived credentials.

      authorization."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_define.html,"Regular access to AWS accounts within the organization should be provided using federated access or a centralized
      identity provider. You should also centralize your identity management and ensure that there
      is an established practice to integrate AWS access to your employee access lifecycle. For
      example, when an employee changes to a job role with a different access level, their group
      membership should also change to reflect their new access requirements.

When defining access requirements for non-human identities, determine which applications
      and components need access and how permissions are granted. Using IAM roles built with the
      least privilege access model is a recommended approach. AWS Managed
        policies provide predefined IAM policies that cover most common use cases."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_define.html,"AWS services, such as AWS Secrets Manager and AWS Systems Manager
        Parameter Store, can help decouple secrets from the application or workload securely
      in cases where it's not feasible to use IAM roles. In Secrets Manager, you can establish
      automatic rotation for your credentials. You can use Systems Manager to reference parameters in your
      scripts, commands, SSM documents, configuration, and automation workflows by using the unique
      name that you specified when you created the parameter.

You can use AWS Identity and Access Management Roles Anywhere to obtain temporary security credentials in
        IAM for workloads that run outside of AWS. Your workloads can use the
        same IAM
        policies and IAM roles that you use with AWS applications to access AWS resources."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_define.html,"Where possible, prefer short-term temporary credentials over
      long-term static credentials. For scenarios in which you need 
      users with programmatic access and long-term credentials,
      use access
        key last used information to rotate and remove access keys.

Users need programmatic access if they want to interact with AWS outside of the AWS Management Console. The way to grant programmatic access depends on the type of user that's accessing AWS.

To grant users programmatic access, choose one of the following options.

SEC03-BP02 Grant least privilege access

PDF

RSS

It's a best practice to grant only the access that identities
      require to perform specific actions on specific resources under
      specific conditions. Use group and identity attributes to
      dynamically set permissions at scale, rather than defining
      permissions for individual users. For example, you can allow a
      group of developers access to manage only resources for their
      project. This way, if a developer leaves the project, the
      developer’s access is automatically revoked without changing the
      underlying access policies."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_least_privileges.html,"Desired outcome: Users should only have the permissions
    required to do their job. Users should only be given access to production environments to
    perform a specific task within a limited time period, and access should be revoked once that
    task is complete. Permissions should be revoked when no longer needed, including when a user
    moves onto a different project or job function. Administrator privileges should be given only to
    a small group of trusted administrators. Permissions should be reviewed regularly to avoid
    permission creep. Machine or system accounts should be given the smallest set of permissions
    needed to complete their tasks.

Common anti-patterns:

Defaulting to granting users administrator permissions.

Using the root user for day-to-day activities.

Creating policies that are overly permissive, but without full administrator
        privileges.

Not reviewing permissions to understand whether they permit least privilege access."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_least_privileges.html,"Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:
    High

Implementation guidance

The principle of
        least
        privilege states that identities should only be permitted
        to perform the smallest set of actions necessary to fulfill a
        specific task. This balances usability, efficiency, and
        security. Operating under this principle helps limit unintended
        access and helps track who has access to what resources. IAM
        users and roles have no permissions by default. The root user
        has full access by default and should be tightly controlled,
        monitored, and used only for
        tasks
        that require root access.

IAM policies are used to explicitly grant permissions to IAM
        roles or specific resources. For example, identity-based
        policies can be attached to IAM groups, while S3 buckets can be
        controlled by resource-based policies."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_least_privileges.html,"When creating an IAM policy, you can specify the service
        actions, resources, and conditions that must be true for AWS to
        allow or deny access. AWS supports a variety of conditions to
        help you scope down access. For example, by using the
        PrincipalOrgID
        condition
        key, you can deny actions if the requestor isn’t a part
        of your AWS Organization."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_least_privileges.html,"You can also control requests that AWS services make on your
        behalf, such as AWS CloudFormation creating an AWS Lambda
        function, using the CalledVia condition key. You should layer
        different policy types to establish defense-in-depth and limit
        the overall permissions of your users. You can also restrict
        what permissions can be granted and under what conditions. For
        example, you can allow your application teams to create their
        own IAM policies for systems they build, but must also apply a
        Permission
        Boundary to limit the maximum permissions the system can
        receive.

Implementation steps"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_least_privileges.html,"Implementation steps

Implement least privilege
              policies: Assign access policies with least
            privilege to IAM groups and roles to reflect the user’s role
            or function that you have defined.
          
          
             
          
              
                Base policies on API
                  usage: One way to determine the needed
                permissions is to review AWS CloudTrail logs. This review
                allows you to create permissions tailored to the actions
                that the user actually performs within AWS.
                IAM
                  Access Analyzer can automatically generate an IAM policy
                  based
                on
                  activity. You can use IAM Access Advisor at the
                organization or account level to
                track
                the
                  last accessed information for a particular policy."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_least_privileges.html,"Consider using
              AWS           managed policies for job functions. When
            starting to create fine-grained permissions policies, it can
            be difficult to know where to start. AWS has managed policies
            for common job roles, for example billing, database
            administrators, and data scientists. These policies can help
            narrow the access that users have while determining how to
            implement the least privilege policies.

Remove unnecessary permissions: Remove permissions that
            are not needed and trim back overly permissive policies. IAM Access
              Analyzer policy generation can help fine-tune permissions policies."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_least_privileges.html,"Ensure that users have limited access to production
              environments: Users should only have access to production environments with
            a valid use case. After the user performs the specific tasks that required production
            access, access should be revoked. Limiting access to production environments helps
            prevent unintended production-impacting events and lowers the scope of impact of
            unintended access.

Consider permissions boundaries: A permissions
            boundary is a feature for using a managed policy that sets the maximum permissions that
            an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity. An entity's permissions boundary
            allows it to perform only the actions that are allowed by both its identity-based
            policies and its permissions boundaries."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_least_privileges.html,"Consider  resource tags for
              permissions: An attribute-based access control model using resource tags
            allows you to grant access based on resource purpose, owner, environment, or other
            criteria. For example, you can use resource tags to differentiate between development
            and production environments. Using these tags, you can restrict developers to the
            development environment. By combining tagging and permissions policies, you can achieve
            fine-grained resource access without needing to define complicated, custom policies for
            every job function."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_least_privileges.html,"Use
          service
            control policies for AWS Organizations. Service control policies centrally control the maximum available
        permissions for member accounts in your organization.
        Importantly, service control policies allow you to restrict root
        user permissions in member accounts. Also consider using AWS Control Tower, which provides prescriptive managed controls that
        enrich AWS Organizations. You can also define your own controls
        within Control Tower.

Establish a user lifecycle policy for
              your organization: User lifecycle policies define
            tasks to perform when users are onboarded onto AWS, change job
            role or scope, or no longer need access to AWS. Permission
            reviews should be done during each step of a user’s lifecycle
            to verify that permissions are properly restrictive and to
            avoid permissions creep."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_least_privileges.html,"Establish a regular schedule to review permissions and remove any
              unneeded permissions: You should regularly review user access to verify
            that users do not have overly permissive access. AWS Config and IAM Access Analyzer can help when auditing user permissions.

Establish a job role matrix: A job role matrix visualizes the various roles and access levels required within your AWS footprint. Using a job role matrix, you can define and separate permissions based on user responsibilities within your organization. Use groups instead of applying permissions directly to individual users or roles.

A process that allows emergency access to your workload in the
    unlikely event of an automated process or pipeline issue. This will
    help you rely on least privilege access, but ensure users can obtain
    the right level of access when they require it. For example, establish
    a process for administrators to verify and approve their request, such as an emergency
    AWS cross-account role for access, or a specific process for administrators to follow to
    validate and approve an emergency request.

Common anti-patterns:

Not having an emergency process in place to recover from an outage with your existing
        identity configuration.

Granting long term elevated permissions for troubleshooting or recovery purposes.

Level of risk exposed if this best practice
    is not established: Medium"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_emergency_process.html,"Implementation guidance

Establishing emergency access can take several forms for which you should be prepared.
      The first is a failure of your primary identity provider. In this case, you should rely on a
      second method of access with the required permissions to recover. This method could be a
      backup identity provider or a user. This second method should be tightly controlled,
        monitored, and notify in the event it is used. The emergency access identity should
      source from an account specific for this purpose and only have permissions to assume a role
      specifically designed for recovery."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_emergency_process.html,"You should also be prepared for emergency access where temporary elevated administrative
      access is needed. A common scenario is to limit mutating permissions to an automated process
      used for deploying changes. In the event that this process has an issue, users might need to
      request elevated permissions to restore functionality. In this case, establish a process where

As your teams determine what access is required, remove unneeded permissions and establish review processes to achieve least privilege permissions. Continually monitor and remove unused identities and permissions for both human and machine access.

Desired outcome: Permission policies should adhere to the least privilege principle. As job duties and roles become better defined, your permission policies need to be reviewed to remove unnecessary permissions. This approach lessens the scope of impact should credentials be inadvertently exposed or otherwise accessed without authorization.

Common anti-patterns:

Defaulting to granting users administrator permissions.

Creating policies that are overly permissive, but without full administrator privileges.

Keeping permission policies after they are no longer needed."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_continuous_reduction.html,"Level of risk exposed if this best practice
    is not established: Medium

Implementation guidance

As teams and projects are just getting started, permissive permission policies might be used to inspire innovation and agility. For example, in a development or test environment, developers can be given access to a broad set of AWS services. We recommend that you evaluate access continuously and restrict access to only those services and service actions that are necessary to complete the current job. We recommend this evaluation for both human and machine identities. Machine identities, sometimes called system or service accounts, are identities that give AWS access to applications or servers. This access is especially important in a production environment, where overly permissive permissions can have a broad impact and potentially expose customer data."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_continuous_reduction.html,"AWS provides multiple methods to help identify unused users, roles, permissions, and credentials. AWS can also help analyze access activity of IAM users and roles, including associated access keys, and access to AWS resources such as objects in Amazon S3 buckets. AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer policy generation can assist you in creating restrictive permission policies based on the actual services and actions a principal interacts with.  Attribute-based access control (ABAC) can help simplify permissions management, as you can provide permissions to users using their attributes instead of attaching permissions policies directly to each user.

Implementation steps

Use AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer: IAM Access Analyzer helps identify resources in your organization and accounts, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets or IAM roles that are shared with an external entity."

For example, you can use last accessed information to identify the specific Amazon S3 actions that your application role requires and restrict the role’s access to only those actions. Last accessed information features are available in the AWS Management Console and programmatically allow you to incorporate them into your infrastructure workflows and automated tools."

Establish common controls that restrict access to all identities in
    your organization. For example, you can restrict access to specific
    AWS Regions, or prevent your operators from deleting common
    resources, such as an IAM role used
    for your central security team.

Common anti-patterns:

Running workloads in your Organizational administrator account.

Running production and non-production workloads in the same account.

Level of risk exposed if this best practice
    is not established: Medium

Implementation guidance"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_define_guardrails.html,"As you grow and manage additional workloads in AWS, you should separate these workloads
      using accounts and manage those accounts using AWS Organizations. We recommend that you establish
      common permission guardrails that restrict access to all identities in your organization. For
      example, you can restrict access to specific AWS Regions, or prevent your team from deleting
      common resources, such as an IAM role used by your central security team."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_define_guardrails.html,"You can get started by implementing example service control
      policies, such as preventing users from turning off key services.
      SCPs use the IAM policy language and allow you to establish
      controls that all IAM principals (users and roles) adhere to. You
      can restrict access to specific service actions, resources and
      based on specific condition to meet the access control needs of
      your organization. If necessary, you can define exceptions to your
      guardrails. For example, you can restrict service actions for all
      IAM entities in the account except for a specific administrator
      role."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_define_guardrails.html,"We recommend you avoid running workloads in your management account. The management
      account should be used to govern and deploy security guardrails that will affect member
      accounts. Some AWS services support the use of a delegated administrator account. When
      available, you should use this delegated account instead of the management account. You should
      strongly limit access to the Organizational administrator account.

Using a multi-account strategy allows you to have greater flexibility in applying
      guardrails to your workloads. The AWS Security Reference Architecture gives prescriptive
      guidance on how to design your account structure. AWS services such as AWS Control Tower provide
      capabilities to centrally manage both preventative and detective controls across your
      organization. Define a clear purpose for each account or OU within your organization and limit
      controls in line with that purpose.

Integrate access controls with operator and application lifecycle
    and your centralized federation provider. For example, remove a
    user’s access when they leave the organization or change roles.

As you manage workloads using separate accounts, there will be cases where you need to share
    resources between those accounts. We recommend that you share resources using AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM). This service allows you to easily
    and securely share AWS resources within your AWS Organizations and Organizational Units. Using AWS RAM,
    access to shared resources is automatically granted or revoked as accounts are moved in and out
    of the Organization or Organization Unit with which they are shared. This helps ensure that
    resources are only shared with the accounts that you intend."

Continually monitor findings that highlight public and cross-account access. Reduce public access and cross-account access to only the specific resources that require this access.

Desired outcome: Know which of your AWS resources are shared and with whom. Continually monitor and audit your shared resources to verify they are shared with only authorized principals.

Common anti-patterns:

Not keeping an inventory of shared resources.

Not following a process for approval of cross-account or public access to resources.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_analyze_cross_account.html,"If your account is in AWS Organizations, you can grant access to resources to the entire organization, specific organizational units, or individual accounts. If your account is not a member of an organization, you can share resources with individual accounts. You can grant direct cross-account access using resource-based policies — for example, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket policies — or by allowing a principal in another account to assume an IAM role in your account. When using resource policies, verify that access is only granted to authorized principals. Define a process to approve all resources which are required to be publicly available."

Consider configuring IAM Access Analyzer with AWS Organizations to verify that you have visibility to all your accounts. IAM Access Analyzer also allows you to preview findings before deploying resource permissions. This allows you to validate that your policy changes grant only the intended public and cross-account access to your resources. When designing for multi-account access, you can use trust policies to control in what cases a role can be assumed. For example, you could use the PrincipalOrgId condition key to deny an attempt to assume a role from outside your AWS Organizations."

Additionally, if you are using AWS Organizations, you can create a service control policy that prevents changes to Amazon S3 public access policies. AWS Trusted Advisor checks for Amazon S3 buckets that have open access permissions. Bucket permissions that grant, upload, or delete access to everyone create potential security issues by allowing anyone to add, modify, or remove items in a bucket.

As the number of workloads grows, you might need to share access to resources in those workloads or provision 
    the resources multiple times across multiple accounts. You might have constructs to compartmentalize your 
    environment, such as having development, testing, and production environments. However, having separation 
    constructs does not limit you from being able to share securely. By sharing components that overlap, you 
    can reduce operational overhead and allow for a consistent experience without guessing what you might have 
    missed while creating the same resource multiple times."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_share_securely.html,"Desired outcome: Minimize unintended access by using secure methods to share 
    resources within your organization, and help with your data loss prevention initiative. Reduce your 
    operational overhead compared to managing individual components, reduce errors from manually creating 
    the same component multiple times, and increase your workloads’ scalability. You can benefit from decreased 
    time to resolution in multi-point failure scenarios, and increase your confidence in determining when a 
    component is no longer needed. For prescriptive guidance on analyzing externally shared resources, 
    see SEC03-BP07 Analyze public and cross-account access.

Common anti-patterns:

Lack of process to continually monitor and automatically alert on unexpected external share.

SEC03-BP09 Share resources securely with a third party

PDF

RSS

The security of your cloud environment doesn’t stop at your organization. Your organization might rely on a third party to manage a portion of your data. The permission management for the third-party managed system should follow the practice of just-in-time access using the principle of least privilege with temporary credentials. By working closely with a third party, you can reduce the scope of impact and risk of unintended access together."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_share_securely_third_party.html,"Desired outcome: Long-term AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials, IAM access keys, and secret keys that are associated with a user can be used by anyone as long as the credentials are valid and active. Using an IAM role and temporary credentials helps you improve your overall security stance by reducing the effort to maintain long-term credentials, including the management and operational overhead of those sensitive details. By using a universally unique identifier (UUID) for the external ID in the IAM trust policy, and keeping the IAM policies attached to the IAM role under your control, you can audit and verify that the access granted to the third party is not too permissive. For prescriptive guidance on analyzing externally shared resources, see SEC03-BP07 Analyze public and cross-account access.

Common anti-patterns:

Using the default IAM trust policy without any conditions.

Using long-term IAM credentials and access keys.

Reusing external IDs."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_share_securely_third_party.html,"Level of risk exposed if this best practice
    is not established: Medium

Implementation guidance

You might want to allow sharing resources outside of AWS Organizations or grant a third party access to your account. For example, a third party might provide a monitoring solution that needs to access resources within your account. In those cases, create an IAM cross-account role with only the privileges needed by the third party. Additionally, define a trust policy using the external ID condition. When using an external ID, you or the third party can generate a unique ID for each customer, third party, or tenancy. The unique ID should not be controlled by anyone but you after it’s created. The third party must implement a process to relate the external ID to the customer in a secure, auditable, and reproduceable manner.

You can also use IAM Roles Anywhere to manage IAM roles for applications outside of AWS that use AWS APIs."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_share_securely_third_party.html,"If the third party no longer requires access to your environment, remove the role. Avoid providing long-term credentials to a third party. Maintain awareness of other AWS services that support sharing. For example, the AWS Well-Architected Tool allows sharing a workload with other AWS accounts, and AWS Resource Access Manager helps you securely share an AWS resource you own with other accounts.

Implementation steps"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_share_securely_third_party.html,"Use cross-account roles to provide access to external accounts.
        
        
          Cross-account roles reduce the amount of sensitive information that is stored by external accounts and third parties for servicing their customers. Cross-account roles allow you to grant access to AWS resources in your account securely to a third party, such as AWS Partners or other accounts in your organization, while maintaining the ability to manage and audit that access. 
        
        
          The third party might be providing service to you from a hybrid infrastructure or alternatively pulling data into an offsite location. IAM Roles Anywhere helps you allow third party workloads to securely interact with your AWS workloads and further reduce the need for long-term credentials."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_share_securely_third_party.html,"You should not use long-term credentials, or access keys associated with users, to provide external account access. Instead, use cross-account roles to provide the cross-account access."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_share_securely_third_party.html,"Use an external ID with third parties.
        
        
          Using an external ID allows you to designate who can assume a role in an IAM trust policy. The trust policy can require that the user assuming the role assert the condition and target in which they are operating. It also provides a way for the account owner to permit the role to be assumed only under specific circumstances. The primary function of the external ID is to address and prevent the confused deputy problem.
        
        
          Use an external ID if you are an AWS account owner and you have configured a role for a third party that accesses other AWS accounts in addition to yours, or when you are in the position of assuming roles on behalf of different customers. Work with your third party or AWS Partner to establish an external ID condition to include in IAM trust policy."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_share_securely_third_party.html,"Use universally unique external IDs.
        
        
          Implement a process that generates random unique value for an external ID, such as a universally unique identifier (UUID). A third party reusing external IDs across different customers does not address the confused deputy problem, because customer A might be able to view data of customer B by using the role ARN of customer B along with the duplicated external ID. In a multi-tenant environment, where a third party supports multiple customers with different AWS accounts, the third party must use a different unique ID as the external ID for each AWS account. The third party is responsible for detecting duplicate external IDs and securely mapping each customer to their respective external ID. The third party should test to verify that they can only assume the role when specifying the external ID. The third party should refrain from storing the customer role ARN and the external ID until the external ID is required."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_share_securely_third_party.html,"The external ID is not treated as a secret, but the external ID must not be an easily guessable value, such as a phone number, name, or account ID. Make the external ID a read-only field so that the external ID cannot be changed for the purpose of impersonating the setup.
        
        
          You or the third party can generate the external ID. Define a process to determine who is responsible for generating the ID. Regardless of the entity creating the external ID, the third party enforces uniqueness and formats consistently across customers."

          Deprecate the use of long-term credentials and use cross-account roles or IAM Roles Anywhere. If you must use long-term credentials, establish a plan to migrate to role-based access. For details on managing keys, see Identity Management. Also work with your AWS account team and the third party to establish risk mitigation runbook. For prescriptive guidance on responding to and mitigating the potential impact of security incident, see Incident response."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_share_securely_third_party.html,"Verify that setup has prescriptive guidance or is automated.
        
        
          The policy created for cross-account access in your accounts must follow the least-privilege principle. The third party must provide a role policy document or automated setup mechanism that uses an AWS CloudFormation template or an equivalent for you. This reduces the chance of errors associated with manual policy creation and offers an auditable trail. For more information on using a AWS CloudFormation template to create cross-account roles, see Cross-Account Roles. 
        
        
          The third party should provide an automated, auditable setup mechanism. However, by using the role policy document outlining the access needed, you should automate the setup of the role. Using a AWS CloudFormation template or equivalent, you should monitor for changes with drift detection as part of the audit practice."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_permissions_share_securely_third_party.html,"Account for changes.
        
        
          Your account structure, your need for the third party, or their service offering being provided might change. You should anticipate changes and failures, and plan accordingly with the right people, process, and technology. Audit the level of access you provide on a periodic basis, and implement detection methods to alert you to unexpected changes. Monitor and audit the use of the role and the datastore of the external IDs. You should be prepared to revoke third-party access, either temporarily or permanently, as a result of unexpected changes or access patterns. Also, measure the impact to your revocation operation, including the time it takes to perform, the people involved, the cost, and the impact to other resources.

Detection consists of two parts: detection of unexpected or unwanted configuration changes,
    and the detection of unexpected behavior. The first can take place at multiple places in an
    application delivery lifecycle. Using infrastructure as code (for example, a CloudFormation
    template), you can check for unwanted configuration before a workload is deployed by
    implementing checks in the CI/CD pipelines or source control. Then, as you deploy a workload
    into non-production and production environments, you can check configuration using native AWS,
    open source, or AWS Partner tools. These checks can be for configuration that does not meet
    security principles or best practices, or for changes that were made between a tested and
    deployed configuration. For a running application, you can check whether the configuration has
    been changed in an unexpected fashion, including outside of a known deployment or automated
    scaling event."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/detection.html,"For the second part of detection, unexpected behavior, you can use tools or by alerting on
    an increase in a particular type of API call. Using Amazon GuardDuty, you can be alerted when
    unexpected and potentially unauthorized or malicious activity occurs within your AWS accounts.
    You should also explicitly monitor for mutating API calls that you would not expect to be used
    in your workload, and API calls that change the security posture."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/detection.html,"Detection allows you to identify a potential security misconfiguration, threat, or
    unexpected behavior. It’s an essential part of the security lifecycle and can be used to support
    a quality process, a legal or compliance obligation, and for threat identification and response
    efforts. There are different types of detection mechanisms. For example, logs from your workload
    can be analyzed for exploits that are being used. You should regularly review the detection
    mechanisms related to your workload to ensure that you are meeting internal and external
    policies and requirements. Automated alerting and notifications should be based on defined
    conditions to allow your teams or tools to investigate. These mechanisms are important reactive
    factors that can help your organization identify and understand the scope of anomalous activity."

Retain security event logs from services and applications. This is a fundamental principle of security for audit, investigations, and operational use cases, and a common security requirement driven by governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) standards, policies, and procedures.

Desired outcome: An organization should be able to reliably and consistently retrieve security event logs from AWS services and applications in a timely manner when required to fulfill an internal process or obligation, such as a security incident response. Consider centralizing logs for better operational results.

Common anti-patterns:

Logs are stored in perpetuity or deleted too soon.

Everybody can access logs.

Relying entirely on manual processes for log governance and use.

Storing every single type of log just in case it is needed."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_detect_investigate_events_app_service_logging.html,"Checking log integrity only when necessary.

Benefits of establishing this best practice: Implement a root cause analysis (RCA) mechanism for security incidents and a source of evidence for your governance, risk, and compliance obligations.

Level of risk exposed if this best practice
    is not established: High

Implementation guidance

During a security investigation or other use cases based on your requirements, you need to be able to review relevant logs to record and understand the full scope and timeline of the incident. Logs are also required for alert generation, indicating that certain actions of interest have happened. It is critical to select, turn on, store, and set up querying and retrieval mechanisms and alerting.

Implementation steps"

Ahead of a security investigation, you need to capture relevant logs to retroactively reconstruct activity in an AWS account. Select log sources relevant to your workloads.
        
        
          The log source selection criteria should be based on the use cases required by your business. Establish a trail for each AWS account using AWS CloudTrail or an AWS Organizations trail, and configure an Amazon S3 bucket for it."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_detect_investigate_events_app_service_logging.html,"AWS CloudTrail is a logging service that tracks API calls made against an AWS account capturing AWS service activity. It’s turned on by default with a 90-day retention of management events that can be retrieved through CloudTrail Event history using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or an AWS SDK. For longer retention and visibility of data events, create a CloudTrail trail and associate it with an Amazon S3 bucket, and optionally with a Amazon CloudWatch log group. Alternatively, you can create a CloudTrail Lake, which retains CloudTrail logs for up to seven years and provides a SQL-based querying facility"

The two most common log storage services are Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon CloudWatch. For long retention periods, it is recommended to use Amazon S3 for its cost effectiveness and flexible lifecycle capabilities. If the primary logging option is Amazon CloudWatch Logs, as an option, you should consider archiving less frequently accessed logs to Amazon S3."

Security operations teams rely on the collection of logs and the use of search tools to
    discover potential events of interest, which might indicate unauthorized activity or
    unintentional change. However, simply analyzing collected data and manually
    processing information is insufficient to keep up with the volume of information
    flowing from complex architectures. Analysis and reporting alone don’t facilitate the
    assignment of the right resources to work an event in a timely fashion."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_detect_investigate_events_analyze_all.html,"A best practice for building a mature security operations team is to deeply integrate the
    flow of security events and findings into a notification and workflow system such as a ticketing
    system, a bug or issue system, or other security information and event management (SIEM) system.
    This takes the workflow out of email and static reports, and allows you to route, escalate, and
    manage events or findings. Many organizations are also integrating security alerts into their
    chat or collaboration, and developer productivity platforms. For organizations embarking on
    automation, an API-driven, low-latency ticketing system offers considerable flexibility when
    planning what to automate first."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_detect_investigate_events_analyze_all.html,"This best practice applies not only to security events generated from log messages depicting
    user activity or network events, but also from changes detected in the infrastructure itself.
    The ability to detect change, determine whether a change was appropriate, and then route that
    information to the correct remediation workflow is essential in maintaining and validating a
    secure architecture, in the context of changes where the nature of their undesirability is
    sufficiently subtle that they cannot currently be prevented with a combination of

Using automation to investigate and remediate events reduces human
    effort and error, and allows you to scale investigation
    capabilities. Regular reviews will help you tune automation tools,
    and continuously iterate.

In AWS, investigating events of interest and information on potentially unexpected
    changes into an automated workflow can be achieved using Amazon EventBridge.
    This service provides a scalable rules engine designed to broker both native AWS
    event formats (such as AWS CloudTrail events), as well as custom events you can
    generate from your application. Amazon GuardDuty also allows you to route events
    to a workflow system for those building incident response systems (AWS Step Functions),
    or to a central Security Account, or to a bucket for further analysis."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_detect_investigate_events_auto_response.html,"Detecting change and routing this information to the correct workflow can also be
    accomplished using AWS Config Rules and Conformance Packs. AWS Config detects changes to in-scope services (though with higher
    latency than EventBridge) and generates events that can be parsed using AWS Config Rules for rollback, enforcement
    of compliance policy, and forwarding of information to systems, such as change management
    platforms and operational ticketing systems. As well as writing your own Lambda functions to
    respond to AWS Config events, you can also take advantage of the AWS Config Rules Development Kit, and a library of open source AWS Config Rules.
    Conformance packs are a collection of AWS Config Rules and remediation actions you deploy as a single
    entity authored as a YAML template. A sample conformance pack template is available for the Well-Architected Security
    Pillar.

Create alerts that are sent to and can be actioned by your team. Ensure that alerts include
    relevant information for the team to take action. For each detective mechanism you have, you
    should also have a process, in the form of a runbook or playbook, to investigate.
    For example, when you use Amazon GuardDuty, it
    generates different findings. You should have a runbook entry for each finding type, for example, if a
      trojan is discovered, your runbook has simple instructions that instruct someone to
    investigate and remediate.

Infrastructure protection

PDF

RSS

Infrastructure protection encompasses control methodologies, such as defense in depth, that
    are necessary to meet best practices and organizational or regulatory obligations. Use of these
    methodologies is critical for successful, ongoing operations in the cloud."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/infrastructure-protection.html,"Infrastructure protection is a key part of an information security program. It ensures that
    systems and services within your workload are protected against unintended and unauthorized
    access, and potential vulnerabilities. For example, you’ll define trust boundaries (for example,
    network and account boundaries), system security configuration and maintenance (for example,
    hardening, minimization and patching), operating system authentication and authorizations (for
    example, users, keys, and access levels), and other appropriate policy-enforcement points (for
    example, web application firewalls and/or API gateways).

Regions, Availability Zones, AWS Local Zones, and AWS
    Outposts

Make sure you are familiar with Regions, Availability Zones, AWS Local
          Zones, and AWS Outposts,
        which are components of the AWS secure global infrastructure."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/infrastructure-protection.html,"AWS has the concept of a Region, which is a physical location around the world where we
        cluster data centers. We call each group of logical data centers an Availability Zone (AZ).
        Each AWS Region consists of multiple, isolated, and physically separate AZs within a
        geographic area. If you have data residency requirements, you can choose the AWS Region that
        is close to your desired location. You retain complete control and ownership over the Region
        in which your data is physically located, which can be helpful for meeting your regional
        compliance and data residency requirements. Each AZ has independent power, cooling, and
        physical security. If an application is partitioned across AZs, you are better isolated and
        protected from issues such as power outages, lightning strikes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and
        more. AZs are physically separated by a meaningful distance, many kilometers, from any other"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/infrastructure-protection.html,"AZ, although all are within 100 km (60 miles) of each other. All AZs in an AWS Region are
        interconnected with high-bandwidth, low-latency networking, using fully redundant, dedicated
        metro fiber providing high-throughput, low-latency networking between AZs. All traffic
        between AZs is encrypted. AWS customers focused on high availability can design their
        applications to run in multiple AZs to achieve even greater fault-tolerance. AWS Regions
        meet the highest levels of security, compliance, and data protection."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/infrastructure-protection.html,"AWS Local Zones place compute, storage, database, and other select AWS services closer
        to end users. With AWS Local Zones, you can easily run highly demanding applications that
        require single-digit millisecond latencies to your end users, such as media and
        entertainment content creation, real-time gaming, reservoir simulations, electronic design
        automation, and machine learning. Each AWS Local Zone location is an extension of an AWS
        Region where you can run your latency-sensitive applications, using AWS services such as
        Amazon EC2, Amazon VPC, Amazon EBS, Amazon File Storage, and Elastic Load Balancing in
        geographic proximity to end users. AWS Local Zones provide a high-bandwidth, secure
        connection between local workloads and those running in the AWS Region, allowing you to
        seamlessly connect to the full range of in-region services through the same APIs and tool
        sets."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/infrastructure-protection.html,"AWS Outposts bring native AWS services, infrastructure, and operating models to
        virtually any data center, co-location space, or on-premises facility. You can use the same
        AWS APIs, tools, and infrastructure across on-premises facilities and the AWS Cloud to
        deliver a truly consistent hybrid experience. AWS Outposts is designed for connected
        environments and can be used to support workloads that must remain on premises due to low
        latency or local data processing needs.

In AWS, there are a number of approaches to infrastructure protection. The following

Users, both in your workforce and your customers, can be located anywhere. You need
        to pivot from traditional models of trusting anyone and anything that has access to your
        network. When you follow the principle of applying security at all layers, you employ a
          Zero Trust approach. Zero Trust security is a model where application components
        or microservices are considered discrete from each other and no component or microservice
        trusts any other."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/protecting-networks.html,"The careful planning and management of your network design forms the
      foundation of how you provide isolation and boundaries for resources within your workload.
      Because many resources in your workload operate in a VPC and inherit the security properties,
      it’s critical that the design is supported with inspection and protection mechanisms backed by
      automation. Likewise, for workloads that operate outside a VPC, using purely edge services
      and/or serverless, the best practices apply in a more simplified approach. Refer to the AWS
        Well-Architected Serverless Applications Lens for specific guidance on serverless

Group components that share sensitivity requirements into layers to minimize the potential scope of impact of unauthorized access. For example, a database cluster in a virtual private cloud (VPC) with no need for internet access should be placed in subnets with no route to or from the internet.  Traffic should only flow from the adjacent next least sensitive resource. Consider a web application sitting behind a load balancer. Your database should not be accessible directly from the load balancer. Only the business logic or web server should have direct access to your database."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_network_protection_create_layers.html,"Desired outcome: Create a layered network. Layered networks help logically group similar networking components. They also shrink the potential scope of impact of unauthorized network access. A properly layered network makes it harder for unauthorized users to pivot to additional resources within your AWS environment. In addition to securing internal network paths, you should also protect your network edge, such as web applications and API endpoints.

Common anti-patterns:

Creating all resources in a single VPC or subnet.

Using overly permissive security groups.

Failing to use subnets.

Allowing direct access to data stores such as databases.

Level of risk exposed if this best practice
    is not established: High

Implementation guidance"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_network_protection_create_layers.html,"Components such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database clusters, and AWS Lambda functions that share reachability requirements can be segmented into layers formed by subnets. Consider deploying serverless workloads, such as Lambda functions, within a VPC or behind an Amazon API Gateway. AWS Fargate (Fargate) tasks that have no need for internet access should be placed in subnets with no route to or from the internet. This layered approach mitigates the impact of a single layer misconfiguration, which could allow unintended access. For AWS Lambda, you can run your functions in your VPC to take advantage of VPC-based controls."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_network_protection_create_layers.html,"For network connectivity that can include thousands of VPCs, AWS accounts, and on-premises networks, you should use AWS Transit Gateway. Transit Gateway acts as a hub that controls how traffic is routed among all the connected networks, which act like spokes. Traffic between Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) and Transit Gateway remains on the AWS private network, which reduces external exposure to unauthorized users and potential security issues. Transit Gateway Inter-Region peering also encrypts inter-Region traffic with no single point of failure or bandwidth bottleneck.

Implementation steps

Use Reachability Analyzer to analyze the path between a source and destination based on configuration: Reachability Analyzer allows you to automate verification of connectivity to and from VPC connected resources. Note that this analysis is done by reviewing configuration (no network packets are sent in conducting the analysis)."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_network_protection_create_layers.html,"Use Amazon VPC Network Access Analyzer to identify unintended network access to resources: Amazon VPC Network Access Analyzer allows you to specify your network access requirements and identify potential network paths.

Consider whether resources need to be in a public subnet: Do not place resources in public subnets of your VPC unless they absolutely must receive inbound network traffic from public sources.

Create subnets in your VPCs: Create subnets for each network layer (in groups that include multiple Availability Zones) to enhance micro-segmentation. Also verify that you have associated the correct route tables with your subnets to control routing and internet connectivity.

Use AWS Firewall Manager to manage your VPC security groups: AWS Firewall Manager helps lessen the management burden of using multiple security groups."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_network_protection_create_layers.html,"Use AWS WAF to protect against common web vulnerabilities: AWS WAF can help enhance edge security by inspecting traffic for common web vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection. It also allows you to restrict traffic from IP addresses originating from certain countries or geographical locations.

Use Amazon CloudFront as a content distribution network (CDN): Amazon CloudFront can help speed up your web application by storing data closer to your users. It can also improve edge security by enforcing HTTPS, restricting access to geographic areas, and ensuring that network traffic can only access resources when routed through CloudFront.

Use Amazon API Gateway when creating application programming interfaces (APIs): Amazon API Gateway helps publish, monitor, and secure REST, HTTPS, and WebSocket APIs.

When architecting your network topology, you should examine the
    connectivity requirements of each component. For example, if a
    component requires internet accessibility (inbound and outbound),
    connectivity to VPCs, edge services, and external data centers."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_network_protection_layered.html,"A VPC allows you to define your network topology that spans an AWS Region with a private IPv4 address range that you set, or an IPv6
    address range AWS selects. You should apply multiple controls with a
    defense in depth approach for both inbound and outbound traffic,
    including the use of security groups (stateful inspection firewall),
    Network ACLs, subnets, and route tables. Within a VPC, you can
    create subnets in an Availability Zone. Each subnet can have an
    associated route table that defines routing rules for managing the
    paths that traffic takes within the subnet. You can define an
    internet routable subnet by having a route that goes to an internet
    or NAT gateway attached to the VPC, or through another VPC."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_network_protection_layered.html,"When an instance, Amazon Relational Database Service(Amazon RDS) database, or other service is launched within
    a VPC, it has its own security group per network interface. This
    firewall is outside the operating system layer and can be used to
    define rules for allowed inbound and outbound traffic. You can also
    define relationships between security groups. For example, instances

Automate protection mechanisms to provide a self-defending network based on threat
    intelligence and anomaly detection. For example, intrusion detection and prevention tools
    that can adapt to current threats and reduce their impact. A web application firewall is an
    example of where you can automate network protection, for example, by using the
    AWS WAF Security Automations solution (https://github.com/awslabs/aws-waf-security-automations) to automatically block

Inspect and filter your traffic at each layer. You can inspect your
    VPC configurations for potential unintended access
    using VPC
    Network Access Analyzer. You can specify your network access
    requirements and identify potential network paths that do not meet
    them. For components transacting over HTTP-based protocols, a web
    application firewall can help protect from common
    attacks. AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor and
    block HTTP(s) requests that match your configurable rules that are
    forwarded to an Amazon API Gateway API, Amazon CloudFront, or an
    Application Load Balancer. To get started with AWS WAF, you can
    use AWS Managed Rules in combination with your own, or use
    existing partner
    integrations."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_network_protection_inspection.html,"For managing AWS WAF, AWS Shield Advanced protections, and Amazon VPC security groups across AWS Organizations, you can use AWS Firewall Manager. It allows you to centrally configure and manage
    firewall rules across your accounts and applications, making it
    easier to scale enforcement of common rules. It also allows you to
    rapidly respond to attacks,
    using AWS Shield Advanced,
    or solutions that
    can automatically block unwanted requests to your web applications.
    Firewall Manager also works
    with AWS     Network Firewall. AWS Network Firewall is a managed service
    that uses a rules engine to give you fine-grained control over both
    stateful and stateless network traffic. It supports

Compute resources include EC2 instances, containers, AWS Lambda functions, database
      services, IoT devices, and more. Each of these compute resource types require different
      approaches to secure them. However, they do share common strategies that you need to consider:
      defense in depth, vulnerability management, reduction in attack surface, automation of
      configuration and operation, and performing actions at a distance. In this section, you will
      find general guidance for protecting your compute resources for key services. For each AWS
      service used, it’s important for you to check the specific security recommendations in the
      service documentation.

Frequently scan and patch for vulnerabilities in your code, dependencies, and in your infrastructure to help protect against new threats.

Desired outcome: Create and maintain a vulnerability management program. Regularly scan and patch resources such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) containers, and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) workloads. Configure maintenance windows for AWS managed resources, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) databases. Use static code scanning to inspect application source code for common issues. Consider web application penetration testing if your organization has the requisite skills or can hire outside assistance.

Common anti-patterns:

Not having a vulnerability management program."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_protect_compute_vulnerability_management.html,"Performing system patching without considering severity or risk avoidance.

Using software that has passed its vendor-provided end of life (EOL) date.

Implementation guidance"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_protect_compute_vulnerability_management.html,"A vulnerability management program includes security assessment, identifying issues, prioritizing, and performing patch operations as part of resolving the issues. Automation is the key to continually scanning workloads for issues and unintended network exposure and performing remediation. Automating the creation and updating of resources saves time and reduces the risk of configuration errors creating further issues. A well-designed vulnerability management program should also consider vulnerability testing during the development and deployment stages of the software life cycle. Implementing vulnerability management during development and deployment helps lessen the chance that a vulnerability can make its way into your production environment."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_protect_compute_vulnerability_management.html,"Implementing a vulnerability management program requires a good understanding of the AWS Shared Responsibly model and how it relates to your specific workloads. Under the Shared Responsibility Model, AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure of the AWS Cloud. This infrastructure is composed of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run AWS Cloud services. You are responsible for security in the cloud, for example, the actual data, security configuration, and management tasks of Amazon EC2 instances, and verifying that your Amazon S3 objects are properly classified and configured. Your approach to vulnerability management also can vary depending on the services you consume. For example, AWS manages the patching for our managed relational database service, Amazon RDS, but you would be responsible for patching self-hosted databases."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_protect_compute_vulnerability_management.html,"AWS has a range of services to help with your vulnerability management program. Amazon Inspector continually scans AWS workloads for software issues and unintended network access. AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager helps manage patching across your Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon Inspector and Systems Manager can be viewed in AWS Security Hub, a cloud security posture management service that helps automate AWS security checks and centralize security alerts.

Amazon CodeGuru can help identify potential issues in Java and Python applications using static code analysis.

Prioritize remediation of potential security issues by embedding vulnerability assessments early into your continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. Your approach can vary based on the AWS services that you are consuming. To check for potential issues in software running in Amazon EC2 instances, add Amazon Inspector to your pipeline to alert you and stop the build process if issues or potential defects are detected.

    using them in production with AWS-provided tests and your own tests.
    You can also apply AWS-provided security settings to further secure
    your images to meet internal security criteria. For example, you can
    produce images that conform to the Security Technical Implementation
    Guide (STIG) standard using AWS-provided templates."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_protect_compute_reduce_surface.html,"Using third-party static code analysis tools, you can identify common security issues such
    as unchecked function input bounds, as well as applicable common vulnerabilities and exposures
    (CVEs). You can use Amazon CodeGuru for supported
    languages. Dependency checking tools can also be used to determine whether libraries your code
    links against are the latest versions, are themselves free of CVEs, and have licensing
    conditions that meet your software policy requirements."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_protect_compute_reduce_surface.html,"Using Amazon Inspector, you can perform configuration assessments against your instances for known
    CVEs, assess against security benchmarks, and automate the notification of defects. Amazon Inspector runs
    on production instances or in a build pipeline, and it notifies developers and engineers when
    findings are present. You can access findings programmatically and direct your team to backlogs
    and bug-tracking systems. EC2 Image Builder can be
    used to maintain server images (AMIs) with automated patching, AWS-provided security policy
    enforcement, and other customizations. When using containers implement ECR Image
      Scanning in your build pipeline and on a regular basis against your image repository

Implement services that manage resources, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), AWS Lambda, and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), to reduce your security maintenance
    tasks as part of the shared responsibility model. For example, Amazon RDS helps you set up, operate, and scale a relational database,
    automates administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching,
    and backups. This means you have more free time to focus on securing your application in
    other ways described in the AWS Well-Architected Framework. Lambda lets you run
    code without provisioning or managing servers, so you only need to focus on the
    connectivity, invocation, and security at the code level–not the infrastructure or operating

    author, and ensure it has not been tampered with since created by the author. AWS Signer can help ensure the trust and integrity of your code by centrally
    managing the code- signing lifecycle, including signing certification and public and private
    keys. You can learn how to use advanced patterns and best practices for code signing with AWS Lambda. Additionally, a checksum of software that you download, compared to that

Before architecting any workload, foundational practices that influence security should be
    in place. For example, data classification provides a way to categorize data based on levels of
    sensitivity, and encryption protects data by way of rendering it unintelligible to unauthorized
    access. These methods are important because they support objectives such as preventing
    mishandling or complying with regulatory obligations.

In AWS, there are a number of different approaches you can use when addressing data
    protection. The following section describes how to use these approaches.

SEC07-BP01 Identify the data within your workload

PDF

RSS

It’s critical to understand the type and classification of data your workload is
    processing, the associated business processes, where the data is stored, and who is the data
    owner. You should also have an understanding of the applicable legal and compliance requirements
    of your workload, and what data controls need to be enforced. Identifying data is the first step
    in the data classification journey.

Benefits of establishing this best practice:

Data classification allows workload owners to identify locations that store sensitive data
    and determine how that data should be accessed and shared.

Data classification aims to answer the following questions:"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_data_classification_identify_data.html,"What type of data do you have?
      This could be data such as: 
      
         
         
         
         
         
         
         
      
           Intellectual property (IP) such as trade secrets, patents, or contract agreements.
          
        
           Protected health information (PHI) such as medical records that contain medical
            history information connected to an individual. 
        
           Personally identifiable information (PII), such as name, address, date of birth,
            and national ID or registration number. 
        
           Credit card data, such as the Primary Account Number (PAN), cardholder name,
            expiration date, and service code number. 
        
           Where is the sensitive data is stored? 
        
           Who can access, modify, and delete data? 
        
           Understanding user permissions is essential in guarding against potential data
            mishandling."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_data_classification_identify_data.html,"Who can perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD)
          operations? 
      
         
      
           Account for potential escalation of privileges by understanding who can manage
            permissions to the data.

What business impact might occur if the data is disclosed
          unintentionally, altered, or deleted? 
      
         
      
           Understand the risk consequence if data is modified, deleted, or inadvertently
            disclosed.

By knowing the answers to these questions, you can take the following actions:

Decrease sensitive data scope (such as the number of sensitive data locations) and
        limit access to sensitive data to only approved users.

Gain an understanding of different data types so that you can implement appropriate
        data protection mechanisms and techniques, such as encryption, data loss prevention, and
        identity and access management.

Optimize costs by delivering the right control objectives for the data."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_data_classification_identify_data.html,"Confidently answer questions from regulators and auditors regarding the types and
        amount of data, and how data of different sensitivities are isolated from each other.

Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:
    High

Implementation guidance

Data classification is the act of identifying the sensitivity of
        data. It might involve tagging to make the data easily
        searchable and trackable. Data classification also reduces the
        duplication of data, which can help reduce storage and backup
        costs while speeding up the search process."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_data_classification_identify_data.html,"Use services such as Amazon Macie to automate at scale both the
        discovery and classification of sensitive data. Other services,
        such as Amazon EventBridge and AWS Config, can be used to
        automate remediation for data security issues such as
        unencrypted Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets
        and Amazon EC2 EBS volumes or untagged data resources. For a
        complete list of AWS service integrations, see the
        EventBridge
        documentation."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_data_classification_identify_data.html,"Detecting
        PII in unstructured data such as customer emails, support
        tickets, product reviews, and social media, is possible by
        using
        Amazon Comprehend, which is a natural language processing
        (NLP) service that uses machine learning (ML) to find insights
        and relationships like people, places, sentiments, and topics in
        unstructured text. For a list of AWS services that can assist
        with data identification, see
        Common
        techniques to detect PHI and PII data using AWS services.

Another method that supports data classification and protection
        is
        AWS         resource tagging. Tagging allows you to assign metadata
        to your AWS resources that you can use to manage, identify,
        organize, search for, and filter resources."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_data_classification_identify_data.html,"In some cases, you might choose to tag entire resources (such as
        an S3 bucket), especially when a specific workload or service is
        expected to store processes or transmissions of already known
        data classification.

Where appropriate, you can tag an S3 bucket instead of
        individual objects for ease of administration and security
        maintenance.

Protecting data at rest

PDF

RSS

Data at rest represents any data that you persist in non-volatile
      storage for any duration in your workload. This includes block storage, object storage,
      databases, archives, IoT devices, and any other storage medium on which data is persisted.
      Protecting your data at rest reduces the risk of unauthorized access, when encryption and
      appropriate access controls are implemented.

Encryption and tokenization are two important but distinct data protection schemes."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/protecting-data-at-rest.html,"Tokenization is a process that allows you to define a token to
      represent an otherwise sensitive piece of information (for example, a token to represent a
      customer’s credit card number). A token must be meaningless on its own, and must not be
      derived from the data it is tokenizing–therefore, a cryptographic digest is not usable as a
      token. By carefully planning your tokenization approach, you can provide additional protection
      for your content, and you can ensure that you meet your compliance requirements. For example,
      you can reduce the compliance scope of a credit card processing system if you leverage a token
      instead of a credit card number."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/protecting-data-at-rest.html,"Encryption is a way of transforming content in a manner that makes it
      unreadable without a secret key necessary to decrypt the content back into plaintext. Both
      tokenization and encryption can be used to secure and protect information as appropriate.
      Further, masking is a technique that allows part of a piece of data to be redacted to a point
      where the remaining data is not considered sensitive. For example, PCI-DSS allows the last
      four digits of a card number to be retained outside the compliance scope boundary for
      indexing.

Audit the use of encryption keys: Ensure that you
      understand and audit the use of encryption keys to validate that the access control mechanisms
      on the keys are appropriately implemented. For example, any AWS service using an AWS KMS key
      logs each use in AWS CloudTrail. You can then query AWS CloudTrail, by using a tool such as Amazon CloudWatch
      Insights, to ensure that all uses of your keys are valid."

You should enforce the use of encryption for data at rest. Encryption maintains the confidentiality of sensitive data in the event of unauthorized access or accidental disclosure.

Desired outcome: Private data should be encrypted by default when at rest. Encryption helps maintain confidentiality of the data and provides an additional layer of protection against intentional or inadvertent data disclosure or exfiltration. Data that is encrypted cannot be read or accessed without first unencrypting the data. Any data stored unencrypted should be inventoried and controlled.

Common anti-patterns:

Not using encrypt-by-default configurations.

Providing overly permissive access to decryption keys.

Not monitoring the use of encryption and decryption keys.

Storing data unencrypted."

Level of risk exposed if this best practice
    is not established: High

Implementation guidance

Map encryption keys to data classifications within your workloads. This approach helps protect against overly permissive access when using either a single, or very small number of encryption keys for your data (see SEC07-BP01 Identify the data within your workload)."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_protect_data_rest_encrypt.html,"AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) integrates with many AWS services to make it easier to encrypt your data at rest. For example, in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), you can set default encryption on a bucket so that new objects are automatically encrypted. When using AWS KMS, consider how tightly the data needs to be restricted. Default and service-controlled AWS KMS keys are managed and used on your behalf by AWS. For sensitive data that requires fine-grained access to the underlying encryption key, consider customer managed keys (CMKs). You have full control over CMKs, including rotation and access management through the use of key policies.

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and

Amazon S3 support the enforcement of encryption by setting default encryption. You can use

To help protect your data at rest, enforce access control using
      mechanisms, such as isolation and versioning, and apply the
      principle of least privilege. Prevent the granting of public
      access to your data.

Desired outcome: Verify that only authorized users can
    access data on a need-to-know basis. Protect your data with regular backups and versioning to
    prevent against intentional or inadvertent modification or deletion of data. Isolate critical
    data from other data to protect its confidentiality and data integrity.

Common anti-patterns:

Storing data with different sensitivity requirements or classification together.

Using overly permissive permissions on decryption keys.

Improperly classifying data.

Not retaining detailed backups of important data.

Providing persistent access to production data."

Implementation guidance

Multiple controls can help protect your data at rest, including
        access (using least privilege), isolation, and versioning.
        Access to your data should be audited using detective
        mechanisms, such as AWS CloudTrail, and service level logs, such
        as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) access logs. You
        should inventory what data is publicly accessible, and create a
        plan to reduce the amount of publicly available data over time.

Amazon S3 Glacier Vault Lock and Amazon S3 Object Lock provide
        mandatory access control for objects in Amazon S3—once a vault

    documents that contain steps you use to perform tasks. These documents can be stored in
    source control, be peer reviewed before running, and tested thoroughly to minimize risk compared
    to shell access. Business users could have a dashboard instead of direct access to a data store

Store encryption keys and certificates securely and rotate them at appropriate time
    intervals with strict access control. The best way to accomplish this is to use a managed
    service, such as AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). It lets you easily provision, manage, and
    deploy public and private Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates for use with AWS
    services and your internal connected resources. TLS certificates are used to secure network
    communications and establish the identity of websites over the internet as well as
    resources on private networks. ACM integrates with AWS resources, such as Elastic Load
    Balancers (ELBs), AWS distributions, and APIs on API Gateway, also handling automatic certificate
    renewals. If you use ACM to deploy a private root CA, both certificates and private keys can
    be provided by it for use in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, containers, and so on."

Enforce your defined encryption requirements based on your organization’s policies, regulatory obligations and standards to help meet organizational, legal, and compliance requirements. Only use protocols with encryption when transmitting sensitive data outside of your virtual private cloud (VPC). Encryption helps maintain data confidentiality even when the data transits untrusted networks."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_protect_data_transit_encrypt.html,"Desired outcome: All data should be encrypted in transit using secure TLS protocols and cipher suites. Network traffic between your resources and the internet must be encrypted to mitigate unauthorized access to the data. Network traffic solely within your internal AWS environment should be encrypted using TLS wherever possible. The AWS internal network is encrypted by default and network traffic within a VPC cannot be spoofed or sniffed unless an unauthorized party has gained access to whatever resource is generating traffic (such as Amazon EC2 instances, and Amazon ECS containers). Consider protecting network-to-network traffic with an IPsec virtual private network (VPN).

Common anti-patterns:

Using deprecated versions of SSL, TLS, and cipher suite components (for example, SSL v3.0, 1024-bit RSA keys, and RC4 cipher).

    to move data outside of defined boundaries. For example, GuardDuty can detect Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) read
    activity that is unusual with the Exfiltration:S3/AnomalousBehavior finding. In addition to
    GuardDuty, Amazon VPC Flow Logs, which capture network traffic information, can
    be used with Amazon EventBridge to detect connections, both
    successful and denied. Amazon S3 Access Analyzer can help assess what data is accessible to who in

Even with mature preventive and detective controls, your organization should implement
    mechanisms to respond to and mitigate the potential impact of security incidents. Your
    preparation strongly affects the ability of your teams to operate effectively during an
    incident, to isolate, contain and perform forensics on issues, and to restore operations to a
    known good state. Putting in place the tools and access ahead of a security incident, then
    routinely practicing incident response through game days, helps ensure that you can recover
    while minimizing business disruption.

Design goals of cloud response

PDF

RSS

Although the general processes and mechanisms of incident response, such as those defined
      in the NIST SP
        800-61 Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, remain true, we encourage you to
      evaluate these specific design goals that are relevant to responding to security incidents in
      a cloud environment:

Establish response objectives: Work with your
          stakeholders, legal counsel, and organizational leadership to determine the goal of
          responding to an incident. Some common goals include containing and mitigating the issue,
          recovering the affected resources, preserving data for forensics, and attribution.

Document plans: Create plans to help you respond to,
          communicate during, and recover from an incident.

Respond using the cloud: Implement your response
          patterns where the event and data occurs."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/design-goals-of-cloud-response.html,"Know what you have and what you need: Preserve logs,
          snapshots, and other evidence by copying them to a centralized security cloud account. Use
          tags, metadata, and mechanisms that enforce retention policies. For example, you might
          choose to use the Linux dd command or a Windows equivalent to make a complete copy of the
          data for investigative purposes.

Use redeployment mechanisms: If a security anomaly
          can be attributed to a misconfiguration, the remediation might be as simple as removing
          the variance by redeploying the resources with the proper configuration. When possible,
          make your response mechanisms safe to run more than once and in environments in an
          unknown state.

Automate where possible: As you see issues or
          incidents repeat, build mechanisms that programmatically triage and respond to common
          situations. Use human responses for unique, new, and sensitive incidents."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/design-goals-of-cloud-response.html,"Choose scalable solutions: Strive to match the
          scalability of your organization's approach to cloud computing, and reduce the time
          between detection and response.

Learn and improve your process: When you identify
          gaps in your process, tools, or people, implement plans to fix them. Simulations are safe
          methods to find gaps and improve processes.

In AWS, there are a number of different approaches you can use when addressing incident
      response. The following section describes how to use these approaches:

Educate your security operations and incident
          response staff about cloud technologies and how your organization intends to use them."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/design-goals-of-cloud-response.html,"Prepare your incident response team to detect and
          respond to incidents in the cloud, use detective capabilities, and maintain appropriate
          access to the necessary tools and cloud services. Additionally, prepare the necessary
          runbooks, both manual and automated, to ensure reliable and consistent responses. Work
          with other teams to establish expected baseline operations, and use that knowledge to
          identify deviations from those normal operations.

Simulate both expected and unexpected security events
          within your cloud environment to understand the effectiveness of your preparation.

Iterate on the outcome of your simulation to improve
          the scale of your response posture, reduce time to value, and further reduce risk.

Automated processes allow organizations to spend more time focusing on measures to
      increase the security of their workloads. Automated incident response also makes humans
      available to correlate events, practice simulations, devise new response procedures, perform
      research, develop new skills, and test or build new tools. Despite increased automation, your
      team, specialists, and responders within a security organization still require continuous
      education. We encourage you to review and incorporate the following areas when thinking about
      educating your security teams:"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/educate.html,"Development Skills: Equipping security professionals with
      programming skills will accelerate your organization’s automation efforts. This includes not
      only ensuring education around programming languages, such as Python, but also ensuring
      familiarity with source control system, version control, and CI/CD processes. When developers
      have this understanding, they’ll increase efficiency and reduce errors when automating.

AWS Services: It’s important for your security team to be
      proficient with the security services offered by AWS. Understanding how to use cloud native
      tools will reduce response time and build team confidence. In addition, establish a cadence of
      education about new services and capabilities in order to continually iterate your
      capabilities. Just as the threat landscape changes, so do the tools."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/educate.html,"Application Awareness: Train your incident response team
      on the specifics of the workloads and environments that they own. This includes understanding
      what logs are emitted, what information the logs contain, the traffic flow of the application,
      and what authentication and authorization mechanisms are in use. This is a critical component
      as deep understanding of your organization’s infrastructure and applications provides an
      advantage to protecting them.

The best way to learn is hands-on, through running incident response game days. This
      allows for experts in your team to hone the tools and techniques while teaching others. This
      is covered in more detail in the Simulate section.

Finally, don’t forget to maintain required education for your entire organization.
      Security awareness is an important line of defense. Users should be trained to report
      suspicious behavior to your security team for further investigation."

During an incident, your incident response teams must have access to various tools and the
      workload resources involved in the incident. Make sure that your teams have appropriate
      pre-provisioned access to perform their duties before an event occurs. All tools, access, and
      plans should be documented and tested before an event occurs to make sure that they can
      provide a timely response.

Level of risk exposed if this best practice
    is not established: High

Implementation guidance

An incident management plan is critical to respond, mitigate, and recover from the
      potential impact of security incidents. An incident management plan is a structured process for
      identifying, remediating, and responding in a timely matter to security incidents."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_develop_management_plans.html,"The cloud has many of the same operational roles and requirements found in an on-premises
      environment. When creating an incident management plan, it is important to factor response and
      recovery strategies that best align with your business outcome and compliance requirements.
      For example, if you are operating workloads in AWS that are FedRAMP compliant in the United States,
      it’s useful to adhere to NIST SP
        800-61 Computer Security Handling Guide. Similarly, when operating workloads with
      European PII (personally identifiable information) data, consider scenarios like how you might
      protect and respond to issues related to data residency as mandated by EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Regulations."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_develop_management_plans.html,"When building an incident management plan for your workloads operating in AWS, start
      with the AWS Shared Responsibility
        Model, for building a defense-in-depth approach towards incident response. In this
      model, AWS manages security of the cloud, and you are responsible for security in the cloud.
      This means that you retain control and are responsible for the security controls you choose to
      implement. The AWS Security Incident Response Guide details key concepts and foundational
      guidance for building a cloud-centric incident management plan.

An effective incident management plan must be continually iterated upon, remaining current 
      with your cloud operations goal. Consider using the implementation plans detailed below as 
      you create and evolve your incident management plan."

It’s important for your incident responders to understand when and how the
    forensic investigation fits into your response plan. Your organization should define
    what evidence is collected and what tools are used in the process. Identify and
    prepare forensic investigation capabilities that are suitable, including external
    specialists, tools, and automation. A key decision that you should make upfront is if
    you will collect data from a live system. Some data, such as the contents of volatile
    memory or active network connections, will be lost if the system is powered off or
    rebooted."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_prepare_forensic.html,"Your response team can combine tools, such as AWS Systems Manager, Amazon EventBridge, and AWS Lambda, to automatically run forensic tools within an
    operating system and VPC traffic mirroring to obtain a network packet capture, to
    gather non-persistent evidence. Conduct other activities, such as log analysis or
    analyzing disk images, in a dedicated security account with customized forensic
    workstations and tools accessible to your responders."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_prepare_forensic.html,"Routinely ship relevant logs to a data store that provides high durability and

    evidence securely using Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) Object Lock. This service follows the WORM (write-once-
    read-many) model and prevents objects from being deleted or overwritten for a

Verify that incident responders have the correct access pre-provisioned in AWS to reduce 
    the time needed for investigation through to recovery.

Common anti-patterns:

Using the root account for incident response.

Altering existing accounts.

Manipulating IAM permissions directly when providing just-in-time privilege elevation.

Level of risk exposed if this best practice
    is not established: Medium

Implementation guidance"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_pre_provision_access.html,"AWS recommends reducing or eliminating reliance on long-lived credentials wherever 
      possible, in favor of temporary credentials and just-in-time privilege escalation 
      mechanisms. Long-lived credentials are prone to security risk and increase operational 
      overhead. For most management tasks, as well as incident response tasks, we recommend you implement identity federation
      alongside temporary 
        escalation for administrative access. In this model, a user requests elevation to a 
      higher level of privilege (such as an incident response role) and, provided the user 
      is eligible for elevation, a request is sent to an approver. If the request is approved, 
      the user receives a set of temporary AWS credentials which can be used to complete their 
      tasks. After these credentials expire, the user must submit a new elevation request."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_pre_provision_access.html,"We recommend the use of temporary privilege escalation in the majority of incident response scenarios. The correct way to do this is to use the 
      AWS Security Token Service and session policies 
      to scope access.

There are scenarios where federated identities are unavailable, such as:

Outage related to a compromised identity provider (IdP).

Misconfiguration or human error causing broken federated access management system.

Malicious activity such as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) event or rendering unavailability of the system."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_pre_provision_access.html,"In the preceding cases, there should be emergency break glass access configured to allow 
      investigation and timely remediation of incidents. We recommend that you use a user,   
      group, or role with appropriate permissions to perform tasks and access AWS resources.  Use the root user only for 
      tasks that require root user credentials.
      To verify that incident responders have the correct level of access to AWS and other relevant systems, we recommend the pre-provisioning 
      of dedicated accounts. The accounts require privileged access, and must be 
      tightly controlled and monitored. The accounts must be built with the fewest privileges 
      required to perform the necessary tasks, and the level of access should be based on the 
      playbooks created as part of the incident management plan."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_pre_provision_access.html,"Use purpose-built and dedicated users and roles as a best practice. Temporarily escalating 
      user or role access through the addition of IAM policies both makes it unclear what access 
      users had during the incident, and risks the escalated privileges not being revoked."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_pre_provision_access.html,"It is important to remove as many dependencies as possible to verify that access can be 
      gained under the widest possible number of failure scenarios. To support this, create a 
      playbook to verify that incident response users are created as 
      users in a dedicated security account, and not managed through any existing Federation or 
      single sign-on (SSO) solution. Each individual responder must have their own named account. 
      The account configuration must enforce strong password policy and multi-factor authentication (MFA). 
      If the incident response playbooks only require access to the AWS Management Console, the user should not 
      have access keys configured and should be explicitly disallowed from creating access keys. 
      This can be configured with IAM policies or service control policies (SCPs) as mentioned in 
      the AWS Security Best Practices for AWS Organizations SCPs. The users should have no privileges"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_pre_provision_access.html,other than the ability to assume incident response roles in other accounts.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_pre_provision_access.html,"During an incident it might be necessary to grant access to other internal or external individuals 
      to support investigation, remediation, or recovery activities. In this case, use the playbook 
      mechanism mentioned previously, and there must be a process to verify that any additional access is 
      revoked immediately after the incident is complete.

To verify that the use of incident response roles can be properly monitored and audited, 
      it is essential that the IAM accounts created for this purpose are not shared between 
      individuals, and that the AWS account root user is not used unless required for a specific 
      task. If the root user is required (for example, IAM access to a specific account is unavailable), 
      use a separate process with a playbook available to verify availability of the root user sign-in credentials and 
      MFA token."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_pre_provision_access.html,"To configure the IAM policies for the incident response roles, consider using IAM Access Analyzer 
      to generate policies based on AWS CloudTrail logs. To do this, grant administrator access to the 
      incident response role on a non-production account and run through your playbooks. Once 
      complete, a policy can be created that allows only the actions taken. This policy can then be 
      applied to all the incident response roles across all accounts. You might wish to create a separate 
      IAM policy for each playbook to allow easier management and auditing. Example playbooks could 
      include response plans for ransomware, data breaches, loss of production access, and other 
      scenarios."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_pre_provision_access.html,"Use the incident response accounts to assume dedicated incident response IAM roles in 
      other AWS accounts. These roles must be configured to only be assumable by users in the 
      security account, and the trust relationship must require that the calling principal has 
      authenticated using MFA. The roles must use tightly-scoped IAM policies to control access. 
      Ensure that all AssumeRole requests for these roles are logged in CloudTrail and alerted 
      on, and that any actions taken using these roles are logged.

It is strongly recommended that both the IAM accounts and the IAM roles are
      clearly named to allow them to be easily found in CloudTrail logs. An example of this would be to
      name the IAM accounts <USER_ID>-BREAK-GLASS and
      the IAM roles BREAK-GLASS-ROLE."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_pre_provision_access.html,"CloudTrail is used to log API activity in your AWS accounts and should be used to configure 
      alerts on usage of the incident response roles. Refer to the blog post on configuring alerts 
      when root keys are used. The instructions can be modified to configure the Amazon CloudWatch metric 
      filter-to-filter on AssumeRole events related to the incident response IAM role:

{ $.eventName = ""AssumeRole"" && $.requestParameters.roleArn = ""

As the incident response roles are likely to have a high level of access, it is important 
      that these alerts go to a wide group and are acted upon promptly."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_pre_provision_access.html,"During an incident, it is possible that a responder might require access to systems which are 
      not directly secured by IAM. These could include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances, Amazon Relational Database Service databases, or 
      software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms. It is strongly recommended that rather than using 
      native protocols such as SSH or RDP, AWS Systems Manager Session Manager is used for all 
      administrative access to Amazon EC2 instances. This access can be controlled using IAM, which is 
      secure and audited. It might also be possible to automate parts of your playbooks using 
      AWS Systems Manager Run Command documents, which can reduce user error and improve 
      time to recovery. For access to databases and third-party tools, we recommend storing 
      access credentials in AWS Secrets Manager and granting access to the incident responder 
      roles."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_pre_provision_access.html,"Finally, the management of the incident response IAM accounts should be added to your 
      Joiners, Movers, and Leavers processes and reviewed and tested periodically to verify that 
      only the intended access is allowed.

Ensure that security personnel have the right tools pre-deployed
    into AWS to reduce the time for investigation through to recovery.

To automate security engineering and operations functions, you can use a comprehensive set
    of APIs and tools from AWS. You can fully automate identity management, network security, data
    protection, and monitoring capabilities and deliver them using popular software development
    methods that you already have in place. When you build security automation, your system can
    monitor, review, and initiate a response, rather than having people monitor your security
    position and manually react to events. An effective way to automatically provide searchable and
    relevant log data across AWS services to your incident responders is to turn on Amazon Detective."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_pre_deploy_tools.html,"If your incident response teams continue to respond to alerts in the same way, they
    risk alert fatigue. Over time, the team can become desensitized to alerts and can
    either make mistakes handling ordinary situations or miss unusual alerts.
    Automation helps avoid alert fatigue by using functions that process the repetitive
    and ordinary alerts, leaving humans to handle the sensitive and unique incidents.
    Integrating anomaly detection systems, such as Amazon GuardDuty, AWS CloudTrail Insights, and
    Amazon CloudWatch Anomaly Detection, can reduce the burden of common threshold-based
    alerts."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_pre_deploy_tools.html,"You can improve manual processes by programmatically automating steps in the
    process. After you define the remediation pattern to an event, you can decompose
    that pattern into actionable logic, and write the code to perform that logic.
    Responders can then run that code to remediate the issue. Over time, you can
    automate more and more steps, and ultimately automatically handle whole classes
    of common incidents."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_pre_deploy_tools.html,"For tools that run within the operating system of your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, you should
    evaluate using the AWS Systems Manager Run Command, which allows you to
    remotely and securely administrate instances using an agent that you install on your
    Amazon EC2 instance operating system. It requires the Systems Manager
    Agent (SSM Agent), which is installed by default on many Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Be aware, though, that once an instance has been compromised, no

Recover from the incident: After teams have implemented
      best practices, they can now focus on ensuring the complete removal of the compromise. They
      can do this by restoring files or pieces of data that were compromised during the incident
      from backups or previous versions. Also, they must ensure that all suspicious activity has
      ceased and continue to monitor to ensure a stable state.

Post-incident debrief: This session allows teams to share
      learnings and increase the overall effectiveness of the organization’s incident response plan.
      Here the teams should review handling of the incident in detail, document lessons learned,
      update runbooks based on learnings, and determine if new risk assessments are required.

Game days, also known as simulations or exercises, are internal events that provide a
    structured opportunity to practice your incident management plans and procedures during a
    realistic scenario. These events should exercise responders using the same tools and techniques
    that would be used in a real-world scenario - even mimicking real-world environments. Game days
    are fundamentally about being prepared and iteratively improving your response capabilities.
    Some of the reasons you might find value in performing game day activities include:

Validating readiness

Developing confidence – learning from simulations and training staff

Following compliance or contractual obligations

Generating artifacts for accreditation

Being agile – incremental improvement

Becoming faster and improving tools"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_run_game_days.html,"Refining communication and escalation

Developing comfort with the rare and the unexpected

For these reasons, the value derived from participating in a simulation activity increases
    an organization's effectiveness during stressful events. Developing a simulation activity that
    is both realistic and beneficial can be a difficult exercise. Although testing your procedures
    or automation that handles well-understood events has certain advantages, it is just as valuable
    to participate in creative Security Incident Response Simulations (SIRS) activities to test yourself against the
    unexpected and continuously improve."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_run_game_days.html,"Create custom simulations tailored to your environment, team, and tools. Find an
    issue and design your simulation around it. This could be something like a leaked
    credential, a server communicating with unwanted systems, or a misconfiguration
    that results in unauthorized exposure. Identify engineers who are familiar with your
    organization to create the scenario and another group to participate. The scenario
    should be realistic and challenging enough to be valuable. It should include the
    opportunity to get hands on with logging, notifications, escalations, and initiating
    runbooks or automation. During the simulation, your responders should exercise
    their technical and organizational skills, and leaders should be involved to build their incident management skills. At the end of the simulation, celebrate the efforts
    of the team and look for ways to iterate, repeat, and expand into further simulations."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_run_game_days.html,"AWS has created
      Incident Response Runbook templates that you can use not only to prepare your response
    efforts, but also as a basis for a simulation. When planning, a simulation can be broken into
    five phases.

Evidence gathering: In this phase, a team will get alerts
    through various means, such as an internal ticketing system, alerts from monitoring tooling,
    anonymous tips, or even public news. Teams then start to review infrastructure and application
    logs to determine the source of the compromise. This step should also involve internal
    escalations and incident leadership. Once identified, teams move on to containing the
    incident

Contain the incident: Teams will have determined there
    has been an incident and established the source of the compromise. Teams now should take action
    to contain it, for example, by deactivating compromised credentials, isolating a compute resource,
    or revoking a role’s permission."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_run_game_days.html,"Eradicate the incident: Now that they’ve contained the
    incident, teams will work towards mitigating any vulnerabilities in applications or
    infrastructure configurations that were susceptible to the compromise. This could include
    rotating all credentials used for a workload, modifying Access Control Lists (ACLs) or changing
    network configurations.

Automate containment and recovery of an incident to reduce response times and organizational impact."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_auto_contain.html,"Once you create and practice the processes and tools from your playbooks, you can
    deconstruct the logic into a code-based solution, which can be used as a tool by many
    responders to automate the response and remove variance or guess-work by your responders. This
    can speed up the lifecycle of a response. The next goal is to allow this code to be fully
    automated by being invoked by the alerts or events themselves, rather than by a human
    responder, to create an event-driven response. These processes should also automatically add
    relevant data to your security systems. For example, an incident involving traffic from an
    unwanted IP address can automatically populate an AWS WAF block list or Network Firewall rule

Application security (AppSec) describes the overall process of how
    you design, build, and test the security properties of the workloads
    you develop. You should have appropriately trained people in your
    organization, understand the security properties of your build and
    release infrastructure, and use automation to identify security
    issues.

Adopting application security testing as a regular part of your
    software development lifecycle (SDLC) and post release processes
    help ensure that you have a structured mechanism to identify, fix,
    and prevent application security issues entering your production
    environment."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/application-security.html,"Your application development methodology should include security
    controls as you design, build, deploy, and operate your workloads.
    While doing so, align the process for continuous defect reduction
    and minimizing technical debt. For example, using threat modeling in
    the design phase helps you uncover design flaws early, which makes
    them easier and less costly to fix as opposed to waiting and
    mitigating them later."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/application-security.html,"The cost and complexity to resolve defects is typically lower the
    earlier you are in the SDLC. The easiest way to resolve issues is to
    not have them in the first place, which is why starting with a
    threat model helps you focus on the right outcomes from the design
    phase. As your AppSec program matures, you can increase the amount
    of testing that is performed using automation, improve the fidelity
    of feedback to builders, and reduce the time needed for security
    reviews. All of these actions improve the quality of the software
    you build, and increase the speed of delivering features into
    production.

These implementation guidelines focus on four areas: organization
    and culture, security of the pipeline, security
    in the pipeline, and dependency management.
    Each area provides a set of principles that you can implement. and
    provides an end-to-end view of how you design, develop, build,
    deploy, and operate workloads."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/application-security.html,"In AWS, there are a number of approaches you can use when addressing
    your application security program. Some of these approaches rely on

Provide training to the builders in your organization on common
    practices for the secure development and operation of applications.
    Adopting security focused development practices helps reduce the
    likelihood of issues that are only detected at the security review
    stage.

Desired outcome: Software should be designed and built with
    security in mind. When the builders in an organization are trained on secure development
    practices that start with a threat model, it improves the overall quality and security of the
    software produced. This approach can reduce the time to ship software or features because less
    rework is needed after the security review stage."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_appsec_train_for_application_security.html,"For the purposes of this best practice, secure
    development refers to the software that is being written
    and the tools or systems that support the software development
    lifecycle (SDLC).

Common anti-patterns:

Waiting until a security review, and then considering the
          security properties of a system.

Leaving all security decisions to the security team.

Failing to communicate how the decisions taken in the SDLC
          relate to the overall security expectations or policies of the
          organization.

Engaging in the security review process too late.

Benefits of establishing this best practice:

Better knowledge of the organizational requirements for
          security early in the development cycle.

Being able to identify and remediate potential security issues
          faster, resulting in a quicker delivery of features.

Improved quality of software and systems.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_appsec_train_for_application_security.html,"Implementation guidance

Provide training to the builders in your organization. Starting off with a course on
        threat modeling is a
      good foundation for helping train for security. Ideally, builders should be able to self-serve
      access to information relevant to their workloads. This access helps them make informed
      decisions about the security properties of the systems they build without needing to ask
      another team. The process for engaging the security team for reviews should be clearly defined
      and simple to follow. The steps in the review process should be included in the security
      training. Where known implementation patterns or templates are available, they should be
      simple to find and link to the overall security requirements. Consider using AWS CloudFormation,
      AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) Constructs,
        Service Catalog, or other templating tools to
      reduce the need for custom configuration.

      software being provided."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_appsec_automate_testing_throughout_lifecycle.html,"Desired outcome:  The goal of automated testing is to
    provide a programmatic way of detecting potential issues early and often throughout the
    development lifecycle. When you automate regression testing, you can rerun functional and
    non-functional tests to verify that previously tested software still performs as expected after
    a change. When you define security unit tests to check for common misconfigurations, such as
    broken or missing authentication, you can identify and fix these issues early in the development

As you progress through your SDLC, establish an iterative
        process that includes periodic application reviews with your
        security team. Feedback gathered from these security reviews
        should be addressed and validated as part of your release
        readiness review. These reviews establish a robust application
        security posture, and provide builders with actionable feedback
        to address potential issues.

Implementation steps

Implement consistent IDE, code review, and CI/CD tools that
            include security testing.

Consider where in the SDLC it is appropriate to block
            pipelines instead of just notifying builders that issues
            need to be remediated."

Perform regular penetration testing of your software. This
    mechanism helps identify potential software issues that cannot be
    detected by automated testing or a manual code review. It can also
    help you understand the efficacy of your detective controls.
    Penetration testing should try to determine if the software can be
    made to perform in unexpected ways, such as exposing data that
    should be protected, or granting broader permissions than
    expected."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_appsec_perform_regular_penetration_testing.html,"Desired outcome: Penetration testing is used to detect,
    remediate, and validate your application’s security properties. Regular and scheduled
    penetration testing should be performed as part of the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
    The findings from penetration tests should be addressed prior to the software being released.
    You should analyze the findings from penetration tests to identify if there are issues that
    could be found using automation. Having a regular and repeatable penetration testing process
    that includes an active feedback mechanism helps inform the guidance to builders and improves
    software quality.

Common anti-patterns:

Only penetration testing for known or prevalent security
          issues.

Penetration testing applications without dependent third-party
          tools and libraries.

Only penetration testing for package security issues, and not
          evaluating implemented business logic."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_appsec_perform_regular_penetration_testing.html,"Benefits of establishing this best practice:

Increased confidence in the security properties of the
          software prior to release.

Opportunity to identify preferred application patterns, which
          leads to greater software quality.

A feedback loop that identifies earlier in the development
          cycle where automation or additional training can improve the
          security properties of software.

Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:
    High

Implementation guidance"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_appsec_perform_regular_penetration_testing.html,"Penetration testing is a structured security testing exercise
      where you run planned security breach scenarios to detect,
      remediate, and validate security controls. Penetration tests start
      with reconnaissance, during which data is gathered based on the
      current design of the application and its dependencies. A curated
      list of security-specific testing scenarios are built and run. The
      key purpose of these tests is to uncover security issues in your
      application, which could be exploited for gaining unintended
      access to your environment, or unauthorized access to data. You
      should perform penetration testing when you launch new features,
      or whenever your application has undergone major changes in
      function or technical implementation."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_appsec_perform_regular_penetration_testing.html,"You should identify the most appropriate stage in the development
      lifecycle to perform penetration testing. This testing should
      happen late enough that the functionality of the system is close
      to the intended release state, but with enough time remaining for
      any issues to be remediated.

Implementation steps

Have a structured process for how penetration testing is
            scoped, basing this process on the
            threat
            model is a good way of maintaining context.

Identify the appropriate place in the development cycle to
            perform penetration testing. This should be when there is
            minimal change expected in the application, but with enough
            time to perform remediation.

Train your builders on what to expect from penetration
            testing findings, and how to get information on remediation.

Use tools to speed up the penetration testing process by
            automating common or repeatable tests."

SEC11-BP04 Manual code reviews

PDF

RSS

Perform a manual code review of the software that you
    produce. This process helps verify that the person who wrote the
    code is not the only one checking the code quality.

Desired outcome: Including a manual code review step
    during development increases the quality of the software being written, helps upskill less
    experienced members of the team, and provides an opportunity to identify places where automation
    can be used. Manual code reviews can be supported by automated tools and testing.

Common anti-patterns:

Not performing reviews of code before deployment.

Having the same person write and review the code.

Not using automation to assist or orchestrate code reviews.

Not training builders on application security before they
          review code.

Benefits of establishing this best practice:"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_appsec_manual_code_reviews.html,"Increased code quality.

Increased consistency of code development through reuse of
          common approaches.

          penetration testing and later stages.

Improved knowledge transfer within the team.

Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:

Implementation guidance

The review step should be implemented as part of the overall code
      management flow. The specifics depend on the approach used for
      branching, pull-requests, and merging. You might be using AWS CodeCommit or third-party solutions such as GitHub, GitLab, or
      Bitbucket. Whatever method you use, it’s important to verify that
      your processes require the review of code before it’s deployed in
      a production environment. Using tools such as
      Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer can make it easier to orchestrate the
      code review process.

Implementation steps"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_appsec_manual_code_reviews.html,"Implementation steps

Implement a manual review step as part of your

            proceeding.

Consider
            Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer for managing and assisting in code
            reviews.

Implement an approval flow that requires a code review being
            completed before code can progress to the next stage.

Verify there is a process to identify issues being found
            during manual code reviews that could be detected
            automatically.

Integrate the manual code review step in a way that aligns

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_appsec_centralize_services_for_packages_and_dependencies.html,"Desired outcome: Software is comprised of a set of other
    software packages in addition to the code that is being written. This makes it simple to consume
    implementations of functionality that are repeatedly used, such as a JSON parser or an
    encryption library. Logically centralizing the sources for these packages and dependencies
    provides a mechanism for security teams to validate the properties of the packages before they
    are used. This approach also reduces the risk of an unexpected issue being caused by a change in
    an existing package, or by builder teams including arbitrary packages directly from the

Perform software deployments programmatically where possible.
    This approach reduces the likelihood that a deployment fails or an

    software."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_appsec_deploy_software_programmatically.html,"The benefits of not relying on people to deploy software is the
      greater confidence that what you tested is what gets deployed, and
      that the deployment is performed consistently every time. The
      software should not need to be changed to function in different
      environments. Using the principles of twelve-factor application
      development, specifically the externalizing of configuration,
      allows you to deploy the same code to multiple environments

    emit state so that the integrity of the build environments can be validated.

Common anti-patterns:

Security tests that can be bypassed by builders.

Overly broad permissions for deployment pipelines.

Pipelines not being configured to validate inputs.

Not regularly reviewing the permissions associated with your
          CI/CD infrastructure.

Use of long-term or hardcoded credentials.

Benefits of establishing this best practice:"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_appsec_regularly_assess_security_properties_of_pipelines.html,"Greater confidence in the integrity of the software that is
          built and deployed through the pipelines.

Ability to stop a deployment when there is suspicious
          activity.

Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not
      established: High

Implementation guidance

Starting with managed CI/CD services that support IAM roles
        reduces the risk of credential leakage. Applying the Security
        Pillar principles to your CI/CD pipeline infrastructure can help
        you determine where security improvements can be made. Following
        the
        AWS         Deployment Pipelines Reference Architecture is a good
        starting point for building your CI/CD environments. Regularly
        reviewing the pipeline implementation and analyzing logs for
        unexpected behavior can help you understand the usage patterns
        of the pipelines being used to deploy software.

Implementation steps"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_appsec_regularly_assess_security_properties_of_pipelines.html,"Implementation steps

Start with the
            AWS             Deployment Pipelines Reference Architecture.

Consider using
            AWS             IAM Access Analyzer to programmatically generate
            least privilege IAM policies for the pipelines.

Integrate your pipelines with monitoring and alerting so
            that you are notified of unexpected or abnormal activity,
            for AWS managed services
            Amazon EventBridge allows you to route data to targets such
            as AWS Lambda or
            Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).

SEC11-BP08 Build a program that embeds security ownership in
  workload teams

PDF

RSS

Build a program or mechanism that empowers builder teams to
    make security decisions about the software that they create. Your
    security team still needs to validate these decisions during a
    review, but embedding security ownership in builder teams allows for
    faster, more secure workloads to be built. This mechanism also
    promotes a culture of ownership that positively impacts the
    operation of the systems you build."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_appsec_build_program_that_embeds_security_ownership_in_teams.html,"Desired outcome: To embed security ownership and decision
    making in builder teams, you can either train builders on how to think about security or you can
    augment their training with security people embedded or associated with the builder teams.
    Either approach is valid and allows the team to make higher quality security decisions earlier
    in the development cycle. This ownership model is predicated on training for application
    security. Starting with the threat model for the particular workload helps focus the design
    thinking on the appropriate context. Another benefit of having a community of security focused
    builders, or a group of security engineers working with builder teams, is that you can more
    deeply understand how software is written. This understanding helps you determine the next areas
    for improvement in your automation capability.

Common anti-patterns:

Leaving all security design decisions to a security team."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_appsec_build_program_that_embeds_security_ownership_in_teams.html,"Not addressing security requirements early enough in the
          development process.

Not obtaining feedback from builders and security people on
          the operation of the program.

Benefits of establishing this best practice:

Reduced time to complete security reviews.

Reduction in security issues that are only detected at the
          security review stage.

Improvement in the overall quality of the software being
          written.

Opportunity to identify and understand systemic issues or
          areas of high value improvement.

Reduction in the amount of rework required due to security
          review findings.

Improvement in the perception of the security function.

Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:
    Low

Implementation guidance"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_appsec_build_program_that_embeds_security_ownership_in_teams.html,"Start with the guidance in SEC11-BP01 Train for application security. 
      Then identify the operational model for the program that
      you think might work best for your organization. The two main
      patterns are to train builders or to embed security people in
      builder teams. After you have decided on the initial approach, you
      should pilot with a single or small group of workload teams to
      prove the model works for your organization. Leadership support
      from the builder and security parts of the organization helps with
      the delivery and success of the program. As you build this
      program, it’s important to choose metrics that can be used to show
      the value of the program. Learning from how AWS has approached
      this problem is a good learning experience. This best practice is
      very much focused on organizational change and culture. The tools
      that you use should support the collaboration between the builder"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_appsec_build_program_that_embeds_security_ownership_in_teams.html,and security communities.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_appsec_build_program_that_embeds_security_ownership_in_teams.html,"Implementation steps

Start by training your builders for application security.

Create a community and an onboarding program to educate
            builders.

Pick a name for the program. Guardians, Champions, or
            Advocates are commonly used.

Identify the model to use: train builders, embed security
            engineers, or have affinity security roles.

Identify project sponsors from security, builders, and
            potentially other relevant groups.

Track metrics for the number of people involved in the
            program, the time taken for reviews, and the feedback from
            builders and security people. Use these metrics to make
            improvements.

Security is an ongoing effort. When incidents occur, they should be treated as
    opportunities to improve the security of the architecture. Having strong identity controls,
    automating responses to security events, protecting infrastructure at multiple levels, and
    managing well-classified data with encryption provides defense in depth that every organization
    should implement. This effort is easier thanks to the programmatic functions and AWS features
    and services discussed in this paper.

AWS strives to help you build and operate architectures that protect information,
    systems, and assets while delivering business value.

Introduction"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html,"Introduction

The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the pros and cons of decisions
      you make while building systems on AWS. Using the Framework helps you learn architectural
      best practices for designing and operating secure, reliable, efficient, cost-effective, and
      sustainable workloads in the AWS Cloud.  It provides a way for you to consistently measure
      your architectures against best practices and identify areas for improvement. The process for
      reviewing an architecture is a constructive conversation about architectural decisions, and is
      not an audit mechanism. We believe that having well-architected systems greatly increases the
      likelihood of business success."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html,"AWS Solutions Architects have years of experience architecting solutions across a wide
    variety of business verticals and use cases. We have helped design and review thousands of
    customers’ architectures on AWS. From this experience, we have identified best practices and
    core strategies for architecting systems in the cloud.

The AWS Well-Architected Framework documents a set of foundational questions that help
    you to understand if a specific architecture aligns well with cloud best practices. The
    framework provides a consistent approach to evaluating systems against the qualities you expect
    from modern cloud-based systems, and the remediation that would be required to achieve those
    qualities. As AWS continues to evolve, and we continue to learn more from working with our
    customers, we will continue to refine the definition of well-architected."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html,"This framework is intended for those in technology roles, such as chief technology
    officers (CTOs), architects, developers, and operations team members. It describes AWS best
    practices and strategies to use when designing and operating a cloud workload, and provides
    links to further implementation details and architectural patterns. For more information, see
    the AWS
      Well-Architected homepage.

AWS also provides a service for reviewing your workloads at no charge. The  AWS Well-Architected
      Tool (AWS WA Tool) is a service in the cloud that provides a consistent process for
    you to review and measure your architecture using the AWS Well-Architected Framework. The AWS WA
    Tool provides recommendations for making your workloads more reliable, secure, efficient, and
    cost-effective."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html,"To help you apply best practices, we have created AWS Well-Architected
      Labs, which provides you with a repository of code and documentation to give you
    hands-on experience implementing best practices. We also have teamed up with select AWS Partner
    Network (APN) Partners, who are members of the AWS Well-Architected
      Partner program. These AWS Partners have deep AWS knowledge, and can help you review
    and improve your workloads.

Every day, experts at AWS assist customers in architecting systems to take advantage of
      best practices in the cloud. We work with you on making architectural trade-offs as your
      designs evolve. As you deploy these systems into live environments, we learn how well these
      systems perform and the consequences of those trade-offs.

Based on what we have learned, we have created the AWS
      Well-Architected Framework, which provides a consistent set of
      best practices for customers and partners to evaluate
      architectures, and provides a set of questions you can use to
      evaluate how well an architecture is aligned to AWS best
      practices.

The AWS Well-Architected Framework is based on six pillars —
      operational excellence, security, reliability, performance
      efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability.

Table 1. The pillars of the AWS
        Well-Architected Framework"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/definitions.html,"Operational excellence

The ability to support development and run workloads
              effectively, gain insight into their operations, and to
              continuously improve supporting processes and procedures
              to deliver business value.

Security

The security pillar describes how to take advantage of cloud technologies to
              protect data, systems, and assets in a way that can improve your security
              posture.

Reliability

The reliability pillar encompasses the ability of a workload to perform its
              intended function correctly and consistently when it’s expected to. This includes the
              ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle. This paper
              provides in-depth, best practice guidance for implementing reliable workloads on AWS.

Performance efficiency"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/definitions.html,"The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet
              system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as
              demand changes and technologies evolve.

Cost optimization

The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the
              lowest price point.

Sustainability

The ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources required.

In the AWS Well-Architected Framework, we use these terms:

A component is the code,
          configuration, and AWS Resources that together deliver against a
          requirement. A component is often the unit of technical
          ownership, and is decoupled from other components."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/definitions.html,"The term workload is used to
          identify a set of components that together deliver business
          value. A workload is usually the level of detail that business
          and technology leaders communicate about.

We think about architecture
          as being how components work together in a workload. How
          components communicate and interact is often the focus of
          architecture diagrams.

Milestones mark key changes in your architecture as it
          evolves throughout the product lifecycle (design, implementation, testing, go live, and in
          production).

Within an organization the technology

          required for the business to operate."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/definitions.html,"The level of effort is categorizing the amount of
          time, effort, and complexity a task requires for implementation. Each organization needs
          to consider the size and expertise of the team and the complexity of the workload for
          additional context to properly categorize the level of effort for the
          organization.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/definitions.html,"When architecting workloads, you make trade-offs between pillars based on your business
      context. These business decisions can drive your engineering priorities. You might optimize to improve sustainability impact and reduce cost at the expense of reliability in development environments, or, for mission-critical solutions, you might optimize reliability with increased costs and sustainability impact. In ecommerce
      solutions, performance can affect revenue and customer propensity to buy. Security and
      operational excellence are generally not traded-off against the other pillars.

On architecture

In on-premises environments, customers often have a central team
      for technology architecture that acts as an overlay to other
      product or feature teams to verify they are following best
      practice. Technology architecture teams typically include a set of
      roles such as: Technical Architect (infrastructure), Solutions
      Architect (software), Data Architect, Networking Architect, and
      Security Architect. Often these teams use
      TOGAF
      or the
      Zachman
        Framework as part of an enterprise architecture capability."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/on-architecture.html,"At AWS, we prefer to distribute capabilities into teams rather than having a centralized
      team with that capability. There are risks when you choose to distribute decision making
      authority, for example, verifying that teams are meeting internal standards. We mitigate these
      risks in two ways. First, we have practices (ways of doing things,
      process, standards, and accepted norms) that focus on allowing each team to have that
      capability, and we put in place experts who verify that teams raise the bar on the standards
      they need to meet. Second, we implement mechanisms that carry out
      automated checks to verify standards are being met.

“Good intentions never work, you need good mechanisms to make anything happen” — Jeff
        Bezos."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/on-architecture.html,"This means replacing a human's best efforts with mechanisms (often automated) that check for
      compliance with rules or process. This distributed approach is supported by the Amazon leadership
        principles, and establishes a culture across all roles that works
          back from the customer. Working backward is a fundamental part of our innovation
      process. We start with the customer and what they want, and let that define and guide our
      efforts. Customer-obsessed teams build products in response to a customer need."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/on-architecture.html,"For architecture, this means that we expect every team to have the capability to create
      architectures and to follow best practices. To help new teams gain these capabilities or
      existing teams to raise their bar, we activate access to a virtual community of principal
      engineers who can review their designs and help them understand what AWS best practices are.
      The principal engineering community works to make best practices visible and accessible. One
      way they do this, for example, is through lunchtime talks that focus on applying best
      practices to real examples. These talks are recorded and can be used as part of onboarding
      materials for new team members."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/on-architecture.html,"AWS best practices emerge from our experience running thousands of systems at internet
      scale. We prefer to use data to define best practice, but we also use subject matter experts,
      like principal engineers, to set them. As principal engineers see new best practices emerge,
      they work as a community to verify that teams follow them. In time, these best practices are
      formalized into our internal review processes, and also into mechanisms that enforce
      compliance. The Well-Architected Framework is the customer-facing implementation of our internal
      review process, where we have codified our principal engineering thinking across field roles,
      like Solutions Architecture and internal engineering teams. The Well-Architected Framework is a
      scalable mechanism that lets you take advantage of these learnings."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/on-architecture.html,"By following the approach of a principal engineering community with distributed ownership
      of architecture, we believe that a Well-Architected enterprise architecture can emerge that is
      driven by customer need. Technology leaders (such as a CTOs or development managers), carrying
      out Well-Architected reviews across all your workloads will permit you to better understand the
      risks in your technology portfolio. Using this approach, you can identify themes across teams
      that your organization could address by mechanisms, training, or lunchtime talks where your
      principal engineers can share their thinking on specific areas with multiple teams.

General design principles

PDF

RSS

The Well-Architected Framework identifies a set of general design
      principles to facilitate good design in the cloud:

Stop guessing your capacity needs: If you make a poor
          capacity decision when deploying a workload, you might end up sitting on expensive idle
          resources or dealing with the performance implications of limited capacity. With cloud
          computing, these problems can go away. You can use as much or as little capacity as you
          need, and scale up and down automatically.

Test systems at production
            scale: In the cloud, you can create a
          production-scale test environment on demand, complete your
          testing, and then decommission the resources. Because you only
          pay for the test environment when it's running, you can simulate
          your live environment for a fraction of the cost of testing on
          premises."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/general-design-principles.html,"Automate with architectural
            experimentation in mind: Automation permits you to
          create and replicate your workloads at low cost and avoid the
          expense of manual effort. You can track changes to your
          automation, audit the impact, and revert to previous parameters
          when necessary.

Consider evolutionary architectures: In a traditional
          environment, architectural decisions are often implemented as static, onetime events, with
          a few major versions of a system during its lifetime. As a business and its context
          continue to evolve, these initial decisions might hinder the system's ability to deliver
          changing business requirements. In the cloud, the capability to automate and test on
          demand lowers the risk of impact from design changes. This permits systems to evolve over
          time so that businesses can take advantage of innovations as a standard practice."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/general-design-principles.html,"Drive architectures using data: In the cloud, you can
          collect data on how your architectural choices affect the behavior of your workload.
          This lets you make fact-based decisions on how to improve your workload. Your cloud
          infrastructure is code, so you can use that data to inform your architecture choices and
          improvements over time.

Improve through game days:
          Test how your architecture and processes perform by regularly
          scheduling game days to simulate events in production. This will
          help you understand where improvements can be made and can help
          develop organizational experience in dealing with events.

Creating a software system is a lot like constructing a building. If the foundation is
    not solid, structural problems can undermine the integrity and function of the building. When
    architecting technology solutions, if you neglect the six pillars of operational excellence,
    security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability, it can become challenging
    to build a system that delivers on your expectations and requirements. Incorporating these
    pillars into your architecture will help you produce stable and efficient systems. This will
    allow you to focus on the other aspects of design, such as functional requirements.

There are five design principles for operational excellence in the
      cloud:

Perform operations as code:
        In the cloud, you can apply the same engineering discipline
        that you use for application code to your entire environment.
        You can define your entire workload (applications,
        infrastructure) as code and update it with code. You can
        implement your operations procedures as code and automate their run process by initiating them in response to events. By
        performing operations as code, you limit human error and achieve
        consistent responses to events.

Make frequent, small, reversible
        changes: Design workloads to permit components to be
        updated regularly. Make changes in small increments that can be
        reversed if they fail (without affecting customers when
        possible)."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/oe-design-principles.html,"Refine operations procedures
        frequently: As you use operations procedures, look
        for opportunities to improve them. As you evolve your workload,
        evolve your procedures appropriately. Set up regular game days
        to review and validate that all procedures are effective and
        that teams are familiar with them.

Anticipate failure: Perform “pre-mortem” exercises to
            identify potential sources of failure so that they can be removed or mitigated. Test
            your failure scenarios and validate your understanding of their impact. Test your
            response procedures to verify that they are effective, and that teams are familiar with
            their process. Set up regular game days to test workloads and team responses to
            simulated events."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/oe-design-principles.html,"Learn from all operational failures: Drive improvement
            through lessons learned from all operational events and failures. Share what is learned
            across teams and through the entire organization.

There are four best practice areas for operational excellence in
      the cloud:

Organization

Prepare

Operate

Evolve

Your organization’s leadership defines business objectives. Your
      organization must understand requirements and priorities and use
      these to organize and conduct work to support the achievement of
      business outcomes. Your workload must emit the information
      necessary to support it. Implementing services to achieve
      integration, deployment, and delivery of your workload will
      create an increased ﬂow of beneficial changes into production by
      automating repetitive processes."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/oe-definition.html,"There may be risks inherent in the operation of your workload. Understand those risks and make an informed decision to enter
      production. Your teams must be able to support your workload.
      Business and operational metrics derived from desired business
      outcomes will permit you to understand the health of your
      workload, your operations activities, and respond to incidents.
      Your priorities will change as your business needs and business
      environment changes. Use these as a feedback loop to continually
      drive improvement for your organization and the operation of your
      workload.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/oe-organization.html,"The following questions focus on these considerations for operational excellence. (For a
          list of operational excellence questions and best practices, see the Appendix.)

Everyone must understand their part in achieving business success. Have
                  shared goals in order to set priorities for resources. This will maximize the
                  benefits of your efforts.

Your teams must understand their part in achieving business outcomes. Teams
                  must understand their roles in the success of other teams, the role of other
                  teams in their success, and have shared goals. Understanding responsibility,
                  ownership, how decisions are made, and who has authority to make decisions will
                  help focus efforts and maximize the benefits from your teams.

Provide support for your team members so that they can be more effective in
                  taking action and supporting your business outcome."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/oe-organization.html,"You might find that you want to emphasize a small subset of your
      priorities at some point in time. Use a balanced approach over the
      long term to verify the development of needed capabilities and
      management of risk. Review your priorities regularly and update
      them as needs change. When responsibility and ownership are
      undefined or unknown, you are at risk of both not performing
      necessary action in a timely fashion and of redundant and
      potentially conflicting efforts emerging to address those needs.
      Organizational culture has a direct impact on team member job
      satisfaction and retention. Activate the engagement and
      capabilities of your team members to achieve the success of your
      business. Experimentation is required for innovation to happen and
      turn ideas into outcomes. Recognize that an undesired result is a
      successful experiment that has identified a path that will not
      lead to success."

Successful operation of a workload is measured by the achievement
      of business and customer outcomes. Define expected outcomes,
      determine how success will be measured, and identify metrics
      that will be used in those calculations to determine if your
      workload and operations are successful. Operational health
      includes both the health of the workload and the health and
      success of the operations activities performed in support of the
      workload (for example, deployment and incident response).
      Establish metrics baselines for improvement, investigation, and
      intervention, collect and analyze your metrics, and then
      validate your understanding of operations success and how it
      changes over time. Use collected metrics to determine if you are
      satisfying customer and business needs, and identify areas for
      improvement."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/oe-operate.html,"Efficient and effective management of operational events is

      events based on their business and customer impact. Verify that if
      an alert is raised in response to an event, there is an associated
      process to run with a specifically identified owner.
      Define in advance the personnel required to resolve an event and
      include escalation processes to engage additional personnel, as
      it becomes necessary, based on urgency and impact. Identify and

In the cloud, there are a number of principles that can help you strengthen your workload
      security:

Implement a strong identity foundation: Implement the
          principle of least privilege and enforce separation of duties with appropriate
          authorization for each interaction with your AWS resources. Centralize identity
          management, and aim to eliminate reliance on long-term static credentials.

Maintain traceability: Monitor, alert, and audit
          actions and changes to your environment in real time. Integrate log and metric collection
          with systems to automatically investigate and take action.

Apply security at all layers: Apply a defense in
          depth approach with multiple security controls. Apply to all layers (for example, edge of
          network, VPC, load balancing, every instance and compute service, operating system,
          application, and code)."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-design.html,"Automate security best practices: Automated
          software-based security mechanisms improve your ability to securely scale more rapidly and
          cost-effectively. Create secure architectures, including the implementation of controls
          that are defined and managed as code in version-controlled templates.

Protect data in transit and at rest: Classify your
          data into sensitivity levels and use mechanisms, such as encryption, tokenization, and
          access control where appropriate.

Keep people away from data: Use mechanisms and tools
          to reduce or eliminate the need for direct access or manual processing of data. This
          reduces the risk of mishandling or modification and human error when handling sensitive
          data."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-design.html,"Prepare for security events: Prepare for an incident
          by having incident management and investigation policy and processes that align to your
          organizational requirements. Run incident response simulations and use tools with
          automation to increase your speed for detection, investigation, and recovery.

There are seven best practice areas for security in the cloud:

Security foundations

Identity and access management

Detection

Infrastructure protection

Data protection

Incident response

Application security

Before you architect any workload, you need to put in place
      practices that influence security. You will want to control who
      can do what. In addition, you want to be able to identify security
      incidents, protect your systems and services, and maintain the
      confidentiality and integrity of data through data protection.
      You should have a well-defined and practiced process for
      responding to security incidents. These tools and techniques are
      important because they support objectives such as preventing
      financial loss or complying with regulatory obligations."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-def.html,"The AWS Shared Responsibility Model helps organizations that
      adopt the cloud to achieve their security and compliance goals.
      Because AWS physically secures the infrastructure that supports
      our cloud services, as an AWS customer you can focus on using
      services to accomplish your goals. The AWS Cloud also provides
      greater access to security data and an automated approach to
      responding to security events.

To operate your workload securely, you must apply overarching best
      practices to every area of security. Take requirements and
      processes that you have defined in operational excellence at an
      organizational and workload level, and apply them to all areas.

Staying up to date with AWS and industry recommendations and
      threat intelligence helps you evolve your threat model and control
      objectives. Automating security processes, testing, and validation
      allow you to scale your security operations.

The following question focuses on these considerations for security. (For a list of

                  to all areas. Staying up to date with recommendations from AWS, industry sources,
                  and threat intelligence helps you evolve your threat model and control objectives.
                  Automating security processes, testing, and validation allow you to scale your
                  security operations.

In AWS, segregating different workloads by account, based on their
      function and compliance or data sensitivity requirements, is a
      recommended approach.

Identity and access management

PDF

RSS

Identity and access management are key parts of an information
      security program, ensuring that only authorized and authenticated
      users and components are able to access your resources, and only
      in a manner that you intend. For example, you should define
      principals (that is, accounts, users, roles, and services that can
      perform actions in your account), build out policies aligned
      with these principals, and implement strong credential management.
      These privilege-management elements form the core of
      authentication and authorization."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-iam.html,"In AWS, privilege management is primarily supported by the AWS
      Identity and Access Management (IAM) service, which allows you
      to control user and programmatic access to AWS services and
      resources. You should apply granular policies, which assign permissions to a user, group, role, or resource. You also
      have the ability to require strong password practices, such as
      complexity level, avoiding re-use, and enforcing multi-factor
      authentication (MFA). You can use federation with your existing
      directory service. For workloads that require systems to have
      access to AWS, IAM allows for secure access through roles, instance
      profiles, identity federation, and temporary credentials.

The following questions focus on these considerations for
      security."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-iam.html,"There are two types of identities you need to manage when approaching
                    operating secure AWS workloads. Understanding the type of identity you need to
                    manage and grant access helps you verify the right identities have access to the
                    right resources under the right conditions. 
                  Human Identities: Your administrators, developers, operators, and end users
                  require an identity to access your AWS environments and applications. These are
                  members of your organization, or external users with whom you collaborate, and who
                  interact with your AWS resources via a web browser, client application, or
                  interactive command line tools. 
                  Machine Identities: Your service applications, operational tools, and
                  workloads require an identity to make requests to AWS services, for example, to"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-iam.html,"read data. These identities include machines running in your AWS environment
                  such as Amazon EC2 instances or AWS Lambda functions. You may also manage machine
                  identities for external parties who need access. Additionally, you may also have
                  machines outside of AWS that need access to your AWS environment."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-iam.html,"Manage permissions to control access to people and machine identities that
                  require access to AWS and your workload. Permissions control who can access what,
                  and under what conditions.

Credentials must not be shared between any user or system. User access should be granted
        using a least-privilege approach with best practices including password requirements and MFA
        enforced. Programmatic access, including API calls to AWS services, should be performed
        using temporary and limited-privilege credentials, such as those issued by the
        AWS Security Token Service.

Users need programmatic access if they want to interact with AWS outside of the AWS Management Console. The way to grant programmatic access depends on the type of user that's accessing AWS.

To grant users programmatic access, choose one of the following options.

You can use detective controls to identify a potential security
      threat or incident. They are an essential part of governance
      frameworks and can be used to support a quality process, a legal
      or compliance obligation, and for threat identification and
      response efforts. There are different types of detective controls.
      For example, conducting an inventory of assets and their
      detailed attributes promotes more effective decision making (and
      lifecycle controls) to help establish operational baselines. You
      can also use internal auditing, an examination of controls related
      to information systems, to verify that practices meet policies
      and requirements and that you have set the correct automated
      alerting notifications based on defined conditions. These controls
      are important reactive factors that can help your organization
      identify and understand the scope of anomalous activity."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-detection.html,"In AWS, you can implement detective controls by processing logs,
      events, and monitoring that allows for auditing, automated
      analysis, and alarming. CloudTrail logs,
      AWS API calls, and CloudWatch provide monitoring of metrics with
      alarming, and AWS Config provides configuration history. Amazon
      GuardDuty is a managed threat detection service that continuously
      monitors for malicious or unauthorized behavior to help you
      protect your AWS accounts and workloads. Service-level logs are
      also available, for example, you can use Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to log access requests.

The following question focuses on these considerations for
      security.

Capture and analyze events from logs and metrics to gain visibility. Take
                  action on security events and potential threats to help secure your
                  workload."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-detection.html,"Log management is important to a Well-Architected workload for
      reasons ranging from security or forensics to regulatory or legal
      requirements. It is critical that you analyze logs and respond
      to them so that you can identify potential security incidents.
      AWS provides functionality that makes log management easier to
      implement by giving you the ability to define a data-retention
      lifecycle or define where data will be preserved, archived, or
      eventually deleted. This makes predictable and reliable data
      handling simpler and more cost effective.

Infrastructure protection encompasses control methodologies, such
      as defense in depth, necessary to meet best practices and
      organizational or regulatory obligations. Use of these
      methodologies is critical for successful, ongoing operations in
      either the cloud or on-premises.

In AWS, you can implement stateful and stateless packet
      inspection, either by using AWS-native technologies or by using
      partner products and services available through the AWS Marketplace. You should use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to create a private, secured, and scalable environment in
      which you can define your topology—including gateways, routing
      tables, and public and private subnets.

The following questions focus on these considerations for
      security."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-infrastructure.html,"Any workload that has some form of network connectivity, whether it’s the
                  internet or a private network, requires multiple layers of defense to help protect
                  from external and internal network-based threats.

Compute resources in your workload require multiple layers of defense to help
                  protect from external and internal threats. Compute resources include EC2
                  instances, containers, AWS Lambda functions, database services, IoT devices, and
                  more.

Multiple layers of defense are advisable in any type of
      environment. In the case of infrastructure protection, many of
      the concepts and methods are valid across cloud and on-premises
      models. Enforcing boundary protection, monitoring points of
      ingress and egress, and comprehensive logging, monitoring, and
      alerting are all essential to an effective information security
      plan."

Data protection

Before architecting any system, foundational practices that
      influence security should be in place. For example, data
      classification provides a way to categorize organizational data
      based on levels of sensitivity, and encryption protects data by
      way of rendering it unintelligible to unauthorized access. These
      tools and techniques are important because they support
      objectives such as preventing financial loss or complying with
      regulatory obligations.

In AWS, the following practices facilitate protection of data:

As an AWS customer you maintain full control over your data.

AWS makes it easier for you to encrypt your data and manage
        keys, including regular key rotation, which can be easily
        automated by AWS or maintained by you.

Detailed logging that contains important content, such as file
        access and changes, is available."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-dataprot.html,"AWS has designed storage systems for exceptional resiliency. For
        example, Amazon S3 Standard, S3 Standard–IA, S3 One Zone-IA, and
        Amazon Glacier are all designed to provide 99.999999999%
        durability of objects over a given year. This durability level
        corresponds to an average annual expected loss of 0.000000001%
        of objects.

Versioning, which can be part of a larger data lifecycle
        management process, can protect against accidental overwrites,
        deletes, and similar harm.

AWS never initiates the movement of data between Regions.
        Content placed in a Region will remain in that Region unless you
        explicitly use a feature or leverage a service that provides
        that functionality.

The following questions focus on these considerations for
      security."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-dataprot.html,"Classification provides a way to categorize data, based on criticality and
                  sensitivity in order to help you determine appropriate protection and retention
                  controls.

Protect your data at rest by implementing multiple controls, to reduce the
                  risk of unauthorized access or mishandling.

Protect your data in transit by implementing multiple controls to reduce the
                  risk of unauthorized access or loss.

AWS provides multiple means for encrypting data at rest and in
      transit. We build features into our services that make it easier
      to encrypt your data. For example, we have implemented server-side
      encryption (SSE) for Amazon S3 to make it easier for you to store
      your data in an encrypted form. You can also arrange for the
      entire HTTPS encryption and decryption process (generally known
      as SSL termination) to be handled by Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)."

Incident response

Even with extremely mature preventive and detective controls, your
      organization should still put processes in place to respond to and
      mitigate the potential impact of security incidents. The
      architecture of your workload strongly affects the ability of your
      teams to operate effectively during an incident, to isolate or
      contain systems, and to restore operations to a known good state.
      Putting in place the tools and access ahead of a security
      incident, then routinely practicing incident response through game
      days, will help you verify that your architecture can accommodate
      timely investigation and recovery.

In AWS, the following practices facilitate effective incident
      response:

Detailed logging is available that contains important content,
        such as file access and changes."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-incresp.html,"Events can be automatically processed and launch tools that
        automate responses through the use of AWS APIs.

You can pre-provision tooling and a “clean room” using AWS CloudFormation. This allows you to carry out forensics in a
        safe, isolated environment.

The following question focuses on these considerations for
      security.

Preparation is critical to timely and effective investigation, response to,
                  and recovery from security incidents to help minimize disruption to your
                  organization.

Verify that you have a way to quickly grant access for your
      security team, and automate the isolation of instances as well
      as the capturing of data and state for forensics.

Application security

PDF

RSS

Application security (AppSec) describes the overall process of how
          you design, build, and test the security properties of the workloads
          you develop. You should have appropriately trained people in your
          organization, understand the security properties of your build and
          release infrastructure, and use automation to identify security
          issues.

Adopting application security testing as a regular part of your
          software development lifecycle (SDLC) and post release processes
          help validate that you have a structured mechanism to identify, fix,
          and prevent application security issues entering your production
          environment."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-appsec.html,"Your application development methodology should include security
          controls as you design, build, deploy, and operate your workloads.
          While doing so, align the process for continuous defect reduction
          and minimizing technical debt. For example, using threat modeling in
          the design phase helps you uncover design flaws early, which makes
          them easier and less costly to fix as opposed to waiting and
          mitigating them later."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-appsec.html,"The cost and complexity to resolve defects is typically lower the
          earlier you are in the SDLC. The easiest way to resolve issues is to
          not have them in the first place, which is why starting with a
          threat model helps you focus on the right outcomes from the design
          phase. As your AppSec program matures, you can increase the amount
          of testing that is performed using automation, improve the fidelity
          of feedback to builders, and reduce the time needed for security
          reviews. All of these actions improve the quality of the software
          you build, and increase the speed of delivering features into
          production."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-appsec.html,"These implementation guidelines focus on four areas: organization
          and culture, security of the pipeline, security
          in the pipeline, and dependency management.
          Each area provides a set of principles that you can implement. and
          provides an end-to-end view of how you design, develop, build,
          deploy, and operate workloads.

In AWS, there are a number of approaches you can use when addressing
          your application security program. Some of these approaches rely on
          technology while others focus on the people and organizational
          aspects of your application security program.

The following question focuses on these considerations for application security.

Training people, testing using automation, understanding dependencies, and validating the 
                  security properties of tools and applications help to reduce the likelihood of security issues 
                  in production workloads."

The Reliability pillar encompasses the ability of a workload to perform its intended
      function correctly and consistently when it’s expected to. This includes the ability to
      operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle. This paper provides in-depth, best
      practice guidance for implementing reliable workloads on AWS.

The reliability pillar provides an overview of design principles, best practices, and
      questions. You can find prescriptive guidance on implementation in the Reliability Pillar whitepaper.

Design principles

There are five design principles for reliability in the cloud:

Automatically recover from failure: By monitoring a
            workload for key performance indicators (KPIs), you can start automation when a
            threshold is breached. These KPIs should be a measure of business value, not of the
            technical aspects of the operation of the service. This provides for automatic
            notification and tracking of failures, and for automated recovery processes that work
            around or repair the failure. With more sophisticated automation, it’s possible to
            anticipate and remediate failures before they occur."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel-dp.html,"Test recovery procedures: In
        an on-premises environment, testing is often conducted to
        prove that the workload works in a particular scenario. Testing
        is not typically used to validate recovery strategies. In the
        cloud, you can test how your workload fails, and you can
        validate your recovery procedures. You can use automation to
        simulate different failures or to recreate scenarios that led to
        failures before. This approach exposes failure pathways that you
        can test and fix before a real failure scenario occurs, thus
        reducing risk.

Scale horizontally to increase aggregate
        workload availability: Replace one large resource
        with multiple small resources to reduce the impact of a single
        failure on the overall workload. Distribute requests across
        multiple, smaller resources to verify that they don’t share a
        common point of failure."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel-dp.html,"Stop guessing capacity: A
        common cause of failure in on-premises workloads is resource
        saturation, when the demands placed on a workload exceed the
        capacity of that workload (this is often the objective of denial
        of service attacks). In the cloud, you can monitor demand and
        workload utilization, and automate the addition or removal of
        resources to maintain the more efficient level to satisfy demand
        without over- or under-provisioning. There are still limits, but
        some quotas can be controlled and others can be managed (see
        Manage Service Quotas and Constraints).

Manage change in automation:
        Changes to your infrastructure should be made using
        automation. The changes that must be managed include changes
        to the automation, which then can be tracked and reviewed.

There are four best practice areas for reliability in the cloud:

Foundations

Workload architecture

Change management

Failure management

To achieve reliability, you must start with the foundations — an
      environment where Service Quotas and network topology accommodate
      the workload. The workload architecture of the distributed
      system must be designed to prevent and mitigate failures. The
      workload must handle changes in demand or requirements, and it
      must be designed to detect failure and automatically heal itself.

Foundational requirements are those whose scope extends beyond a
      single workload or project. Before architecting any system,
      foundational requirements that influence reliability should be in
      place. For example, you must have sufficient network bandwidth
      to your data center.

With AWS, most of these foundational requirements are already
      incorporated or can be addressed as needed. The cloud is designed
      to be nearly limitless, so it’s the responsibility of AWS to
      satisfy the requirement for sufficient networking and compute
      capacity, permitting you to change resource size and allocations
      on demand.

The following questions focus on these considerations for reliability. (For a list of
          reliability questions and best practices, see the Appendix.)."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel-found.html,"For cloud-based workload architectures, there are Service Quotas (which are
                  also referred to as service limits). These quotas exist to prevent accidentally
                  provisioning more resources than you need and to limit request rates on API
                  operations so as to protect services from abuse. There are also resource
                  constraints, for example, the rate that you can push bits down a fiber-optic
                  cable, or the amount of storage on a physical disk.

Workloads often exist in multiple environments. These include multiple cloud
                  environments (both publicly accessible and private) and possibly your existing
                  data center infrastructure. Plans must include network considerations such as
                  intra- and inter-system connectivity, public IP address management, private IP
                  address management, and domain name resolution."

Workload architecture

A reliable workload starts with upfront design decisions for both
      software and infrastructure. Your architecture choices will
      impact your workload behavior across all of the Well-Architected
      pillars. For reliability, there are specific patterns you must
      follow.

With AWS, workload developers have their choice of languages and
      technologies to use. AWS SDKs take the complexity out of coding by
      providing language-specific APIs for AWS services. These SDKs,
      plus the choice of languages, permits developers to implement the
      reliability best practices listed here. Developers can also read
      about and learn from how Amazon builds and operates software in
      The
      Amazon Builders' Library.

The following questions focus on these considerations for
      reliability."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel-workload-arch.html,"Build highly scalable and reliable workloads using a service-oriented
                  architecture (SOA) or a microservices architecture. Service-oriented architecture
                  (SOA) is the practice of making software components reusable via service
                  interfaces. Microservices architecture goes further to make components smaller and
                  simpler.

Distributed systems rely on communications networks to interconnect
                  components, such as servers or services. Your workload must operate reliably
                  despite data loss or latency in these networks. Components of the distributed
                  system must operate in a way that does not negatively impact other components or
                  the workload. These best practices prevent failures and improve mean time between
                  failures (MTBF)."

                  impairments. The result is improved mean time to recovery (MTTR).

Changes to your workload or its environment must be anticipated
      and accommodated to achieve reliable operation of the workload.
      Changes include those imposed on your workload, such as spikes in
      demand, and also those from within, such as feature deployments
      and security patches.

Using AWS, you can monitor the behavior of a workload and automate
      the response to KPIs. For example, your workload can add
      additional servers as a workload gains more users. You can control
      who has permission to make workload changes and audit the history
      of these changes.

The following questions focus on these considerations for
      reliability."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel-chg-mgmt.html,"Logs and metrics are powerful tools to gain insight into the health of your
                  workload. You can configure your workload to monitor logs and metrics and send
                  notifications when thresholds are crossed or significant events occur. Monitoring
                  allows your workload to recognize when low-performance thresholds are crossed or
                  failures occur, so it can recover automatically in response.

A scalable workload provides elasticity to add or remove resources
                  automatically so that they closely match the current demand at any given point in
                  time."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel-chg-mgmt.html,"Controlled changes are necessary to deploy new functionality, and to verify
                  that the workloads and the operating environment are running known software and
                  can be patched or replaced in a predictable manner. If these changes are
                  uncontrolled, then it makes it difficult to predict the effect of these changes,
                  or to address issues that arise because of them."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel-chg-mgmt.html,"When you architect a workload to automatically add and remove
      resources in response to changes in demand, this not only
      increases reliability but also validates that business success
      doesn't become a burden. With monitoring in place, your team will
      be automatically alerted when KPIs deviate from expected norms.
      Automatic logging of changes to your environment permits you to
      audit and quickly identify actions that might have impacted
      reliability. Controls on change management certify that you can
      enforce the rules that deliver the reliability you need.

Failure management

PDF

RSS

In any system of reasonable complexity, it is expected that
      failures will occur. Reliability requires that your workload be
      aware of failures as they occur and take action to avoid impact on
      availability. Workloads must be able to both withstand failures
      and automatically repair issues.

With AWS, you can take advantage of automation to react to monitoring data. For example,
          when a particular metric crosses a threshold, you can initiate an automated action to
          remedy the problem. Also, rather than trying to diagnose and fix a failed resource that is
          part of your production environment, you can replace it with a new one and carry out the
          analysis on the failed resource out of band. Since the cloud allows you to stand up
          temporary versions of a whole system at low cost, you can use automated testing to verify
          full recovery processes."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel-failmgmt.html,"The following questions focus on these considerations for
      reliability.

Back up data, applications, and configuration to meet your requirements for
                  recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO).

Fault isolated boundaries limit the effect of a failure within a workload to
                  a limited number of components. Components outside of the boundary are unaffected
                  by the failure. Using multiple fault isolated boundaries, you can limit the impact
                  on your workload.

Workloads with a requirement for high availability and low mean time to
                  recovery (MTTR) must be architected for resiliency.

After you have designed your workload to be resilient to the stresses of
                  production, testing is the only way to verify that it will operate as designed,
                  and deliver the resiliency you expect."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel-failmgmt.html,"Having backups and redundant workload components in place is the start of your DR strategy. RTO and RPO are your objectives for restoration of your workload. Set these based on business needs. Implement a strategy to meet these objectives, considering locations and function of workload resources and data. The probability of disruption and cost of recovery are also key factors that help to inform the business value of providing disaster recovery for a workload."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel-failmgmt.html,"Regularly back up your data and test your backup files to verify
      that you can recover from both logical and physical errors. A
      key to managing failure is the frequent and automated testing of
      workloads to cause failure, and then observe how they recover.
      Do this on a regular schedule and verify that such testing is also
      initiated after significant workload changes. Actively track KPIs, 
      and also the recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point
      objective (RPO), to assess a workload's resiliency (especially
      under failure-testing scenarios). Tracking KPIs will help you
      identify and mitigate single points of failure. The objective is
      to thoroughly test your workload-recovery processes so that you
      are confident that you can recover all your data and continue to
      serve your customers, even in the face of sustained problems. Your
      recovery processes should be as well exercised as your normal"

There are five design principles for performance efficiency in the
      cloud:

Democratize advanced
        technologies: Make advanced technology implementation
        smoother for your team by delegating complex tasks to your cloud
        vendor. Rather than asking your IT team to learn about hosting
        and running a new technology, consider consuming the
        technology as a service. For example, NoSQL databases, media
        transcoding, and machine learning are all technologies that
        require specialized expertise. In the cloud, these
        technologies become services that your team can consume,
        permitting your team to focus on product development rather than
        resource provisioning and management."

Use serverless architectures:
        Serverless architectures remove the need for you to run and
        maintain physical servers for traditional compute activities.
        For example, serverless storage services can act as static
        websites (removing the need for web servers) and event services
        can host code. This removes the operational burden of managing
        physical servers, and can lower transactional costs because
        managed services operate at cloud scale.

Experiment more often: With

There are four best practice areas for performance efficiency in
      the cloud:

Selection

Review

Monitoring

Tradeoffs

Take a data-driven approach to building a high-performance
      architecture. Gather data on all aspects of the architecture, from
      the high-level design to the selection and configuration of
      resource types.

Reviewing your choices on a regular basis validates that you are
      taking advantage of the continually evolving AWS Cloud. Monitoring
      verifies that you are aware of any deviance from expected
      performance. Make trade-oﬀs in your architecture to improve
      performance, such as using compression or caching, or relaxing
      consistency requirements.

The more effective solution for a particular workload varies, and
      solutions often combine multiple approaches. Well-architected
      workloads use multiple solutions and activate different features to
      improve performance.

AWS resources are available in many types and configurations
      so you can find an approach that closely matches your
      workload needs. You can also find options that are not efficiently
      achievable with on-premises infrastructure. For example, a managed
      service such as Amazon DynamoDB provides a fully managed NoSQL
      database with single-digit millisecond latency at any scale.

The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency. (For a
          list of performance efficiency questions and best practices, see the Appendix.)."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-sel.html,"Often, multiple approaches are required for more effective performance across a
                  workload. Well-architected systems use multiple solutions and features to improve
                  performance.

Use a data-driven approach to select the patterns and
      implementation for your architecture and achieve a cost
      effective solution. AWS Solutions Architects, AWS Reference
      Architectures, and AWS Partner Network (APN) partners can help you
      select an architecture based on industry knowledge, but data
      obtained through benchmarking or load testing will be required to
      optimize your architecture."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-sel.html,"Your architecture will likely combine a number of different
      architectural approaches (for example, event-driven, ETL, or
      pipeline). The implementation of your architecture will use the
      AWS services that are specific to the optimization of your
      architecture's performance. In the following sections we discuss
      the four main resource types to consider (compute, storage,
      database, and network).

Compute

PDF

RSS

Selecting compute resources that meet your requirements, performance needs, and
            provide great efficiency of cost and effort will permit you to accomplish more with the
            same number of resources. When evaluating compute options, be aware of your requirements
            for workload performance and cost requirements and use this to make informed decisions.

In AWS, compute is available in three forms: instances, containers, and functions:"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-compute.html,"Instances are virtualized servers, permitting you to
                change their capabilities with a button or an API call. Because resource decisions
                in the cloud aren’t fixed, you can experiment with different server types. At AWS,
                these virtual server instances come in different families and sizes, and they offer
                a wide variety of capabilities, including solid-state drives (SSDs) and graphics
                processing units (GPUs)."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-compute.html,"Containers are a method of operating system
                virtualization that permit you to run an application and its dependencies in
                resource-isolated processes. AWS Fargate is serverless compute for containers or
                Amazon EC2 can be used if you need control over the installation, configuration, and
                management of your compute environment. You can also choose from multiple container
                orchestration platforms: Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

Functions abstract the run environment from the code
              you want to apply. For example, AWS Lambda permits you to run code without running an
              instance.

The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-compute.html,"The more efficient compute solution for a workload varies based on application
                    design, usage patterns, and configuration settings. Architectures can use
                    different compute solutions for various components and turn on different features
                    to improve performance. Selecting the wrong compute solution for an architecture
                    can lead to lower performance efficiency.

When architecting your use of compute you should take advantage of the elasticity
            mechanisms available to verify you have sufficient capacity to sustain performance as
            demand changes.

Storage

PDF

RSS

Cloud storage is a critical component of cloud computing, holding the information
            used by your workload. Cloud storage is typically more reliable, scalable, and secure
            than traditional on-premises storage systems. Select from object, block, and file storage
            services, and cloud data migration options for your workload.

In AWS, storage is available in three forms: object, block, and file:"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-storage.html,"Object Storage provides a scalable, durable
                platform to make data accessible from any internet location for user-generated
                content, active archive, serverless computing, Big Data storage or backup and
                recovery. Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that
                offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
                Amazon S3 is designed for 99.999999999% (11 9's) of durability, and stores data for
                millions of applications for companies all around the world."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-storage.html,"Block Storage provides highly available,
                consistent, low-latency block storage for each virtual host and is analogous to
                direct-attached storage (DAS) or a Storage Area Network (SAN). Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) is
                designed for workloads that require persistent storage accessible by EC2 instances
                that helps you tune applications with the right storage capacity, performance and
                cost."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-storage.html,"File Storage provides access to a shared file system
              across multiple systems. File storage solutions like Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) are ideal for use
              cases such as large content repositories, development environments, media stores, or
              user home directories. Amazon FSx makes it efficient and cost effective to launch and run
              popular file systems so you can leverage the rich feature sets and fast performance of
              widely used open source and commercially-licensed file systems.

The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-storage.html,"The more efficient storage solution for a system varies based on the kind of
                    access operation (block, file, or object), patterns of access (random or
                    sequential), required throughput, frequency of access (online, offline,
                    archival), frequency of update (WORM, dynamic), and availability and durability
                    constraints. Well-architected systems use multiple storage solutions and turn on
                    different features to improve performance and use resources efficiently.

When you select a storage solution, verifying that it aligns with your access
            patterns will be critical to achieving the performance you want.

Since the network is between all workload components, it can have great impacts,
            both positive and negative, on workload performance and behavior. There are also
            workloads that are heavily dependent on network performance such as high performance computing (HPC) where deep network understanding is important to increase cluster
            performance. Determine the workload requirements for bandwidth, latency,
            jitter, and throughput."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-network.html,"On AWS, networking is virtualized and is available in a number of different types
            and configurations. This makes it efficient to match your networking operations with your
            needs. AWS offers product features (for example, Enhanced Networking, Amazon EBS-optimized
            instances, Amazon S3 transfer acceleration, and dynamic Amazon CloudFront) to optimize network
            traffic. AWS also offers networking features (for example, Amazon Route 53 latency routing,
            Amazon VPC endpoints, AWS Direct Connect, and AWS Global Accelerator) to reduce network distance or
            jitter.

The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency."

                    throughput requirements, jitter, and bandwidth. Physical constraints, such as
                    user or on-premises resources, determine location options. These constraints can
                    be offset with edge locations or resource placement.

You must consider location when deploying your network. You can choose to place
            resources close to where they will be used to reduce distance. Use networking metrics to
            make changes to networking configuration as the workload evolves. By taking advantage of
            Regions, placement groups, and edge services, you can significantly improve performance.

Cloud technologies are rapidly evolving and you must verify that workload components are
          using the latest technologies and approaches to continually improve performance. You must
          continually evaluate and consider changes to your workload components to verify you are
          meeting its performance and cost objectives. New technologies, such as machine learning
          and artificial intelligence (AI), can permit you to reimagine customer experiences and
          innovate across all of your business workloads.

Take advantage of the continual innovation at AWS driven by
      customer need. We release new Regions, edge locations, services,
      and features regularly. Any of these releases could positively
      improve the performance efficiency of your architecture.

The following question focuses on these considerations for
      performance efficiency."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-review.html,"When architecting workloads, there are finite options that you can choose

Architectures performing poorly are usually the result of a
      non-existent or broken performance review process. If your
      architecture is performing poorly, implementing a performance
      review process will permit you to apply Deming’s plan-do-check-act

After you implement your workload, you must monitor its
      performance so that you can remediate any issues before they
      impact your customers. Monitoring metrics should be used to raise
      alarms when thresholds are breached."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-monitoring.html,"Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that
      provides you with data and actionable insights to monitor your
      workload, respond to system-wide performance changes, optimize
      resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational
      health. CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data in the
      form of logs, metrics, and events from workloads that run on AWS
      and on-premises servers. AWS X-Ray
      helps developers analyze and debug production, distributed
      applications. With AWS X-Ray, you can glean insights into how your
      application is performing and discover root causes and identify
      performance bottlenecks. You can use these insights to react
      quickly and keep your workload running smoothly.

The following question focuses on these considerations for

Validating that you do not see false positives is key to an
      effective monitoring solution. Automated initiation functions avoid human
      error and can reduce the time it takes to fix problems. Plan for
      game days, where simulations are conducted in the production

When you architect solutions, think about tradeoffs to validate a more efficient approach. Depending on your situation, you could trade
      consistency, durability, and space for time or latency, to deliver
      higher performance.

Using AWS, you can go global in minutes and deploy resources in
      multiple locations across the globe to be closer to your end
      users. You can also dynamically add read only replicas to
      information stores (such as database systems) to reduce the load
      on the primary database.

The following question focuses on these considerations for
      performance efficiency.

When architecting solutions, determining tradeoffs permits you to select an
                  more efficient approach. Often you can improve performance by trading consistency,
                  durability, and space for time and latency."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-tradeoffs.html,"As you make changes to the workload, collect and evaluate metrics
      to determine the impact of those changes. Measure the impacts to
      the system and to the end user to understand how your trade-oﬀs
      impact your workload. Use a systematic approach, such as load
      testing, to explore whether the tradeoff improves performance.

There are five design principles for cost optimization in the
      cloud:

Implement Cloud Financial Management: To achieve
            financial success and accelerate business value realization in the cloud, invest in Cloud Financial Management and Cost Optimization. Your organization should
            dedicate time and resources to build capability in this new domain of technology and
            usage management. Similar to your Security or Operational Excellence capability, you
            need to build capability through knowledge building, programs, resources, and processes
            to become a cost-efficient organization."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-dp.html,"Adopt a consumption model:
        Pay only for the computing resources that you require and
        increase or decrease usage depending on business requirements,
        not by using elaborate forecasting. For example, development and
        test environments are typically only used for eight hours a day
        during the work week. You can stop these resources when they are
        not in use for a potential cost savings of 75% (40 hours versus
        168 hours).

Measure overall efficiency:
        Measure the business output of the workload and the costs
        associated with delivering it. Use this measure to know the
        gains you make from increasing output and reducing costs."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-dp.html,"Stop spending money on undifferentiated
        heavy lifting: AWS does the heavy lifting of data
        center operations like racking, stacking, and powering servers.
        It also removes the operational burden of managing operating
        systems and applications with managed services. This permits you
        to focus on your customers and business projects rather than on
        IT infrastructure.

Analyze and attribute
        expenditure: The cloud makes it simple to accurately
        identify the usage and cost of systems, which then permits
        transparent attribution of IT costs to individual workload
        owners. This helps measure return on investment (ROI) and gives
        workload owners an opportunity to optimize their resources and
        reduce costs.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-def.html,"As with the other pillars within the Well-Architected Framework, there are tradeoﬀs to
        consider, for example, whether to optimize for speed-to-market or for cost. In some cases,
        it’s more efficient to optimize for speed, going to market quickly, shipping new features, or meeting a deadline, rather than investing in upfront cost optimization. Design decisions are
        sometimes directed by haste rather than data, and the temptation always exists to
        overcompensate “just in case” rather than spend time benchmarking for the most cost-optimal
        deployment. This might lead to over-provisioned and under-optimized deployments. However,
        this is a reasonable choice when you must “lift and shift” resources from your
        on-premises environment to the cloud and then optimize afterwards. Investing the right

Practice Cloud Financial Management

PDF

With the adoption of cloud, technology teams innovate faster due to shortened approval,
          procurement, and infrastructure deployment cycles. A new approach to financial management
          in the cloud is required to realize business value and financial success. This approach is
          Cloud Financial Management, and builds capability across your organization by implementing
          organizational wide knowledge building, programs, resources, and processes.

Many organizations are composed of many different units with
      different priorities. The ability to align your organization to an
      agreed set of financial objectives, and provide your
      organization the mechanisms to meet them, will create a more
      efficient organization. A capable organization will innovate and
      build faster, be more agile and adjust to any internal or external
      factors."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-cfm.html,"In AWS you can use Cost Explorer, and optionally Amazon Athena and
      Amazon QuickSight with the Cost and Usage Report (CUR), to
      provide cost and usage awareness throughout your organization. AWS
      Budgets provides proactive notifications for cost
      and usage. The AWS blogs provide information on new services and
      features to verify you keep up to date with new service
      releases.

The following question focuses on these considerations for cost optimization. (For a list
          of cost optimization questions and best practices, see the Appendix.).

Implementing Cloud Financial Management helps organizations realize
                  business value and financial success as they optimize their cost and usage and
                  scale on AWS."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-cfm.html,"When building a cost optimization function, use members and
      supplement the team with experts in CFM and cost optimization. Existing team
      members will understand how the organization currently functions
      and how to rapidly implement improvements. Also consider
      including people with supplementary or specialist skill sets, such
      as analytics and project management.

When implementing cost awareness in your organization, improve or
      build on existing programs and processes. It is much faster to
      add to what exists than to build new processes and programs. This
      will result in achieving outcomes much faster.

The increased flexibility and agility that the cloud provides encourages innovation and
          fast-paced development and deployment. It decreases the manual processes and time
          associated with provisioning on-premises infrastructure, including identifying hardware
          specifications, negotiating price quotations, managing purchase orders, scheduling
          shipments, and then deploying the resources. However, the ease of use and virtually
          unlimited on-demand capacity requires a new way of thinking about expenditures."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-aware.html,"Many businesses are composed of multiple systems run by various
      teams. The capability to attribute resource costs to the
      individual organization or product owners drives efficient usage
      behavior and helps reduce waste. Accurate cost attribution permits
      you to know which products are truly profitable, and permits you to
      make more informed decisions about where to allocate budget."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-aware.html,"In AWS, you create an account structure with AWS Organizations or
      AWS Control Tower, which provides separation and assists in
      allocation of your costs and usage. You can also use resource
      tagging to apply business and organization information to your
      usage and cost. Use AWS Cost Explorer for visibility into your
      cost and usage, or create customized dashboards and analytics with
      Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight. Controlling your cost and
      usage is done by notifications through AWS Budgets, and controls
      using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), and Service Quotas.

The following questions focus on these considerations for cost
      optimization.

Establish policies and mechanisms to validate that appropriate costs are
                  incurred while objectives are achieved. By employing a checks-and-balances
                  approach, you can innovate without overspending."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-aware.html,"Establish policies and procedures to monitor and appropriately allocate your
                  costs. This permits you to measure and improve the cost efficiency of this
                  workload.

Implement change control and resource management from project inception to
                  end-of-life. This facilitates shutting down unused resources to reduce
                  waste.

You can use cost allocation tags to categorize and track your AWS
      usage and costs. When you apply tags to your AWS resources (such
      as EC2 instances or S3 buckets), AWS generates a cost and usage
      report with your usage and your tags. You can apply tags that
      represent organization categories (such as cost centers, workload
      names, or owners) to organize your costs across multiple services."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-aware.html,"Verify that you use the right level of detail and granularity in cost
      and usage reporting and monitoring. For high level insights and
      trends, use daily granularity with AWS Cost Explorer. For deeper
      analysis and inspection use hourly granularity in AWS Cost Explorer, or Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight with the Cost and
      Usage Report (CUR) at an hourly granularity.

Combining tagged resources with entity lifecycle tracking
      (employees, projects) makes it possible to identify orphaned
      resources or projects that are no longer generating value to the
      organization and should be decommissioned. You can set up billing
      alerts to notify you of predicted overspending.

Cost-effective resources

PDF

RSS

Using the appropriate instances and resources for your workload is
      key to cost savings. For example, a reporting process might take
      five hours to run on a smaller server but one hour to run on a
      larger server that is twice as expensive. Both servers give you
      the same outcome, but the smaller server incurs more cost over
      time.

A well-architected workload uses the most cost-effective
      resources, which can have a significant and positive economic
      impact. You also have the opportunity to use managed services to
      reduce costs. For example, rather than maintaining servers to
      deliver email, you can use a service that charges on a per-message
      basis."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-cereso.html,"AWS offers a variety of flexible and cost-effective pricing
      options to acquire instances from Amazon EC2 and other services in
      a way that more effectively fits your needs. On-Demand
      Instances permit you to pay for compute
      capacity by the hour, with no minimum commitments required.
      Savings Plans and Reserved Instances offer
      savings of up to 75% oﬀ On-Demand pricing. With Spot Instances,
      you can leverage unused Amazon EC2 capacity and offer savings of
      up to 90% oﬀ On-Demand pricing. Spot
      Instances are appropriate where the system can tolerate
      using a fleet of servers where individual servers can come and go
      dynamically, such as stateless web servers, batch processing, or
      when using HPC and big data."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-cereso.html,"Appropriate service selection can also reduce usage and costs;
      such as CloudFront to minimize data transfer, or decrease costs, such as utilizing Amazon Aurora on Amazon RDS to
      remove expensive database licensing costs.

The following questions focus on these considerations for cost
      optimization.

Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon S3 are building-block AWS services. Managed services,
                  such as Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB, are higher level, or application level, AWS services.
                  By selecting the appropriate building blocks and managed services, you can
                  optimize this workload for cost. For example, using managed services, you can
                  reduce or remove much of your administrative and operational overhead, freeing you
                  to work on applications and business-related activities."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-cereso.html,"Verify that you choose the appropriate resource size and number of resources
                  for the task at hand. You minimize waste by selecting the most cost effective
                  type, size, and number.

Use the pricing model that is most appropriate for your resources to minimize
                  expense.

Verify that you plan and monitor data transfer charges so that you can make
                  architectural decisions to minimize costs. A small yet effective architectural
                  change can drastically reduce your operational costs over time.

By factoring in cost during service selection, and using tools
      such as Cost Explorer and AWS Trusted Advisor to regularly review
      your AWS usage, you can actively monitor your utilization and
      adjust your deployments accordingly.

Manage demand and supply resources

PDF

RSS

When you move to the cloud, you pay only for what you need. You
      can supply resources to match the workload demand at the time
      they’re needed, this decreases the need for costly and wasteful
      over provisioning. You can also modify the demand, using a
      throttle, buﬀer, or queue to smooth the demand and serve it with
      less resources resulting in a lower cost, or process it at a
      later time with a batch service."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-mandem.html,"In AWS, you can automatically provision resources to match the
      workload demand. Auto Scaling using demand or time-based
      approaches permit you to add and remove
      resources as needed. If you can anticipate changes in demand, you
      can save more money and validate that your resources match your workload
      needs. You can use Amazon API Gateway to implement throttling, or
      Amazon SQS to implementing a queue in your workload. These will
      both permit you to modify the demand on your workload components.

The following question focuses on these considerations for cost
      optimization."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-mandem.html,"For a workload that has balanced spend and performance, verify that
                  everything you pay for is used and avoid significantly underutilizing instances. A
                  skewed utilization metric in either direction has an adverse impact on your
                  organization, in either operational costs (degraded performance due to
                  over-utilization), or wasted AWS expenditures (due to over-provisioning).

When designing to modify demand and supply resources, actively
      think about the patterns of usage, the time it takes to provision
      new resources, and the predictability of the demand pattern.
      When managing demand, verify you have a correctly sized queue or
      buﬀer, and that you are responding to workload demand in the
      required amount of time.

As AWS releases new services and features, it's a best practice to
      review your existing architectural decisions to verify they
      continue to be the most cost effective. As your requirements
      change, be aggressive in decommissioning resources, entire
      services, and systems that you no longer require.

Implementing new features or resource types can optimize your
      workload incrementally, while minimizing the effort required to
      implement the change. This provides continual improvements in
      efficiency over time and provides you remain on the most updated
      technology to reduce operating costs. You can also replace or add
      new components to the workload with new services. This can
      provide significant increases in efficiency, so it's essential to
      regularly review your workload, and implement new services and
      features."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-opti.html,"The following questions focus on these considerations for cost
      optimization.

As AWS releases new services and features, it's a best practice to review
                  your existing architectural decisions to verify they continue to be the most cost
                  effective.

When regularly reviewing your deployments, assess how newer
      services can help save you money. For example, Amazon Aurora on
      Amazon RDS can reduce costs for relational databases. Using serverless
      such as Lambda can remove the need to operate and manage instances
      to run code.

Evaluate the cost of effort for operations in the cloud, review your time-consuming cloud operations, 
                  and automate them to reduce human efforts and cost by adopting related AWS services, third-party
                  products, or custom tools.

Design principles

PDF

There are six design principles for sustainability in the
      cloud:

Understand your impact: Measure the impact of your cloud workload and model the future impact of your workload. Include all sources of impact, including impacts resulting from customer use of your products, and impacts resulting from their eventual decommissioning and retirement. Compare the productive output with the total impact of your cloud workloads by reviewing the resources and emissions required per unit of work. Use this data to establish key performance indicators (KPIs), evaluate ways to improve productivity while reducing impact, and estimate the impact of proposed changes over time."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sus-design-principles.html,"Establish sustainability goals: For each cloud workload,
          establish long-term sustainability goals such as reducing the compute and storage
          resources required per transaction. Model the return on investment of sustainability
          improvements for existing workloads, and give owners the resources they must invest in
          sustainability goals. Plan for growth, and architect your workloads so that growth results
          in reduced impact intensity measured against an appropriate unit, such as per user or per
          transaction. Goals help you support the wider sustainability goals of your business or
          organization, identify regressions, and prioritize areas of potential improvement."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sus-design-principles.html,"Maximize utilization: Right-size workloads and implement efficient design to verify high utilization and maximize the energy efficiency of the underlying hardware. Two hosts running at 30% utilization are less efficient than one host running at 60% due to baseline power consumption per host. At the same time, reduce or minimize idle resources, processing, and storage to reduce the total energy required to power your workload.

Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings: Support the upstream improvements your partners and suppliers make to help you reduce the impact of your cloud workloads. Continually monitor and evaluate new, more efficient hardware and software offerings. Design for flexibility to permit the rapid adoption of new efficient technologies."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sus-design-principles.html,"Use managed services: Sharing services across a broad customer base helps maximize resource utilization, which reduces the amount of infrastructure needed to support cloud workloads. For example, customers can share the impact of common data center components like power and networking by migrating workloads to the AWS Cloud and adopting managed services, such as AWS Fargate for serverless containers, where AWS operates at scale and is responsible for their efficient operation. Use managed services that can help minimize your impact, such as automatically moving infrequently accessed data to cold storage with Amazon S3 Lifecycle configurations or Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to adjust capacity to meet demand."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sus-design-principles.html,"Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads: Reduce the amount of energy or resources required to use your services. Reduce or reduce the need for customers to upgrade their devices to use your services. Test using device farms to understand expected impact and test with customers to understand the actual impact from using your services.

There are six best practice areas for sustainability in the cloud:

Region selection

Alignment to demand

Software and architecture

Data

Hardware and services

Process and culture

Sustainability in the cloud is a nearly continuous effort focused primarily on energy reduction and efficiency across all components of a workload by achieving the maximum benefit from the resources provisioned and minimizing the total resources required. This effort can range from the initial selection of an efficient programming language, adoption of modern algorithms, use of efficient data storage techniques, deploying to correctly sized and efficient compute infrastructure, and minimizing requirements for high-powered end user hardware.

The way users and applications consume your workloads and other resources can help you identify improvements to meet sustainability goals. Scale infrastructure to continually match demand and verify that you use only the minimum resources required to support your users. Align service levels to customer needs. Position resources to limit the network required for users and applications to consume them. Remove unused assets. Provide your team members with devices that support their needs and minimize their sustainability impact.

Look for opportunities to reduce workload sustainability impacts by making changes to your hardware management practices. Minimize the amount of hardware needed to provision and deploy, and select the most efficient hardware and services for your individual workload.

Use the minimum amount of hardware to meet your needs: Using the capabilities of the

        instance types and take advantage of energy efficiency improvements, including those
        instance types designed to support specific workloads such as machine learning training and
        inference, and video transcoding.

Use managed services: Managed services shift responsibility for maintaining high average
        utilization, and sustainability optimization of the deployed hardware, to AWS. Use managed

Adopt operations that can rapidly introduce sustainability improvements: Test and validate
        potential improvements before deploying them to production. Account for the cost of testing
        when calculating potential future benefit of an improvement. Develop low-cost testing
        operations to drive delivery of small improvements."

        goals."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sus-development-deployment-patterns.html,"Increase utilization of build environments: Use automation and infrastructure as code to
        bring up pre-production environments when needed and take them down when not used. A common
        pattern is to schedule periods of availability that coincide with the working hours of your
        development team members. Hibernation is a useful tool to preserve state and rapidly bring

        farms offer diverse device types so you can support earlier, less popular hardware, and avoid
        customer sustainability impact from unnecessary device upgrades."

The review process

PDF

RSS

The review of architectures must be done in a consistent manner, with a blame-free
    approach that encourages diving deep. It should be a lightweight process (hours not days) that
    is a conversation and not an audit. The purpose of reviewing an architecture is to identify any
    critical issues that might need addressing or areas that could be improved. The outcome of the
    review is a set of actions that should improve the experience of a customer using the workload."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/the-review-process.html,"As discussed in the “On Architecture” section, you will want each
      team member to take responsibility for the quality of its
      architecture. We recommend that the team members who build an
      architecture use the Well-Architected Framework to continually
      review their architecture, rather than holding a formal review
      meeting. A nearly continuous approach permits your team members to
      update answers as the architecture evolves, and improve the
      architecture as you deliver features."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/the-review-process.html,"The AWS Well-Architected Framework is aligned to the way that AWS
      reviews systems and services internally. It is premised on a set
      of design principles that influences architectural approach, and
      questions that verify that people don’t neglect areas that often
      featured in Root Cause Analysis (RCA). Whenever there is a
      significant issue with an internal system, AWS service, or
      customer, we look at the RCA to see if we could improve the review
      processes we use."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/the-review-process.html,"Reviews should be applied at key milestones in the product
      lifecycle, early on in the design phase to avoid one-way
        doors that are difficult
      to change, and then before the go-live date. 
      (Many decisions are reversible, two-way doors. Those decisions can
      use a lightweight process. One-way doors are hard or impossible
      to reverse and require more inspection before making them.) 
      After you go into
      production, your workload will continue to evolve as you add new
      features and change technology implementations. The architecture
      of a workload changes over time. You must follow good
      hygiene practices to stop its architectural characteristics from
      degrading as you evolve it. As you make significant architecture changes, you should follow a set of hygiene processes including a
      Well-Architected review."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/the-review-process.html,"If you want to use the review as a one-time snapshot or
      independent measurement, you will want to verify that you have all
      the right people in the conversation. Often, we find that reviews
      are the first time that a team truly understands what they have
      implemented. An approach that works well when reviewing another
      team's workload is to have a series of informal conversations
      about their architecture where you can glean the answers to most
      questions. You can then follow up with one or two meetings where
      you can gain clarity or dive deep on areas of ambiguity or
      perceived risk.

Here are some suggested items to facilitate your meetings:

A meeting room with whiteboards

Print outs of any diagrams or design notes

Action list of questions that require out-of-band research to
        answer (for example, “did we activate encryption or not?”)"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/the-review-process.html,"After you have done a review, you should have a list of issues
      that you can prioritize based on your business context. You will
      also want to take into account the impact of those issues on the
      day-to-day work of your team. If you address these issues early,
      you could free up time to work on creating business value rather
      than solving recurring problems. As you address issues, you can
      update your review to see how the architecture is improving.

While the value of a review is clear after you have done one, you
      may find that a new team might be resistant at first. Here are some
      objections that can be handled through educating the team on the
      benefits of a review:"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/the-review-process.html,"“We are too busy!” (Often said when the team is getting ready
        for a significant launch.)
      
      
         
         
      
          
            If you are getting ready for a big launch, you will want it
            to go smoothly. The review will permit you to understand
            any problems you might have missed.
          
        
          
            We recommend that you carry out reviews early in the product
            lifecycle to uncover risks and develop a mitigation plan
            aligned with the feature delivery roadmap."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/the-review-process.html,"“We don’t have time to do anything with the results!” (Often
        said when there is an immovable event, such as the Super Bowl,
        that they are targeting.)
      
      
         
      
          
            These events can’t be moved. Do you really want to go into
            it without knowing the risks in your architecture? Even if
            you don’t address all of these issues you can still have
            playbooks for handling them if they materialize.

“We don’t want others to know the secrets of our solution
        implementation!”
      
      
         
      
          
            If you point the team at the questions in the
            Well-Architected Framework, they will see that none of the
            questions reveal any commercial or technical proprietary
            information."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/the-review-process.html,"As you carry out multiple reviews with teams in your organization,
      you might identify thematic issues. For example, you might see
      that a group of teams has clusters of issues in a particular
      pillar or topic. You will want to look at all your reviews in a
      holistic manner, and identify any mechanisms, training, or
      principal engineering talks that could help address those thematic
      issues.

The AWS Well-Architected Framework provides architectural best
      practices across the six pillars for designing and operating
      reliable, secure, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable systems in the
      cloud. The Framework provides a set of questions that allows you
      to review an existing or proposed architecture. It also provides a
      set of AWS best practices for each pillar. Using the Framework
      in your architecture will help you produce stable and efficient
      systems, which allow you to focus on your functional requirements.

OPS01-BP01 Evaluate external customer needs

PDF

RSS

Involve key stakeholders, including business, development, and
    operations teams, to determine where to focus efforts on external
    customer needs. This will ensure that you have a thorough
    understanding of the operations support that is required to achieve
    your desired business outcomes.

Common anti-patterns:

You have decided not to have customer support outside of core
        business hours, but you haven't reviewed historical support
        request data. You do not know whether this will have an impact
        on your customers.

You are developing a new feature but have not engaged your
        customers to find out if it is desired, if desired in what form,
        and without experimentation to validate the need and method of
        delivery."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/ops_priorities_ext_cust_needs.html,"Benefits of establishing this best
    practice: Customers whose needs are satisfied are much
    more likely to remain customers. Evaluating and understanding
    external customer needs will inform how you prioritize your efforts
    to deliver business value.

OPS01-BP02 Evaluate internal customer needs

PDF

RSS

Involve key stakeholders, including business, development, and
    operations teams, when determining where to focus efforts on
    internal customer needs. This will ensure that you have a thorough
    understanding of the operations support that is required to achieve
    business outcomes.

Use your established priorities to focus your improvement efforts
    where they will have the greatest impact (for example, developing
    team skills, improving workload performance, reducing costs,
    automating runbooks, or enhancing monitoring). Update your
    priorities as needs change.

Common anti-patterns:

You have decided to change IP address allocations for your
        product teams, without consulting them, to make managing your
        network easier. You do not know the impact this will have on
        your product teams."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/ops_priorities_int_cust_needs.html,"You are implementing a new development tool but have not engaged
        your internal customers to find out if it is needed or if it is
        compatible with their existing practices.

You are implementing a new monitoring system but have not
        contacted your internal customers to find out if they have
        monitoring or reporting needs that should be considered.

Benefits of establishing this best

OPS01-BP03 Evaluate governance requirements

PDF

RSS

Governance is the set of policies, rules, or frameworks that a company uses to 
    achieve its business goals. Governance requirements are generated from within your 
    organization. They can affect the types of technologies you choose or influence the 
    way you operate your workload. Incorporate organizational governance requirements 
    into your workload. Conformance is the ability to demonstrate that you have implemented 
    governance requirements.

Desired outcome:

Governance requirements are incorporated into the architectural design and operation of your workload.

You can provide proof that you have followed governance requirements.

Governance requirements are regularly reviewed and updated.

Common anti-patterns:"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/ops_priorities_governance_reqs.html,"Your organization mandates that the root account has multi-factor authentication. You failed to implement this requirement and the root account is compromised.

During the design of your workload, you choose an instance type that is not approved by the IT department. You are unable to launch your workload and must conduct a redesign.

You are required to have a disaster recovery plan. You did not create one and your workload suffers an extended outage.

Your team wants to use new instances but your governance requirements have not been updated to allow them.

Benefits of establishing this best
    practice:

Following governance requirements aligns your workload with larger organization policies.

Governance requirements reflect industry standards and best practices for your organization.

Level of risk exposed if this best practice
    is not established: High

Implementation guidance"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/ops_priorities_governance_reqs.html,"Identify governance requirement by working with stakeholders and 
      governance organizations. Include governance requirements into your 
      workload. Be able to demonstrate proof that you’ve followed governance 
      requirements.

Customer example

At AnyCompany Retail, the cloud operations team works with stakeholders 
      across the organization to develop governance requirements. For example, 
      they prohibit SSH access into Amazon EC2 instances. If teams need system access, 
      they are required to use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. The cloud 
      operations team regularly updates governance requirements as new services 
      become available.

Implementation steps

Identify the stakeholders for your workload, including any centralized teams.

Work with stakeholders to identify governance requirements."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/ops_priorities_governance_reqs.html,"Once you’ve generated a list, prioritize the improvement items, and begin implementing them into your workload. 
        
        
           
           
        
            
              Use services like AWS Config to create governance-as-code and validate that governance requirements are followed.
            
          
            
              If you use AWS Organizations, you can leverage Service Control Policies to implement governance requirements.

Provide documentation that validates the implementation.

Level of effort for the implementation plan: Medium. Implementing missing governance requirements
      may result in rework of your workload.

OPS01-BP04 Evaluate compliance requirements

PDF

RSS

Regulatory, industry, and internal compliance requirements are an important driver for defining 
    your organization’s priorities. Your compliance framework may preclude you from using specific 
    technologies or geographic locations. Apply due diligence if no external compliance frameworks are 
    identified. Generate audits or reports that validate compliance.

If you advertise that your product meets specific compliance standards, you must have an internal process for ensuring continuous compliance. Examples of compliance standards include PCI DSS, FedRAMP, and HIPAA. Applicable compliance standards are determined by various factors, such as what types of data the solution stores or transmits and which geographic regions the solution supports.

Desired outcome:"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/ops_priorities_compliance_reqs.html,"Desired outcome:

Regulatory, industry, and internal compliance requirements are incorporated into architectural selection.

You can validate compliance and generate audit reports.

Common anti-patterns:

Parts of your workload fall under the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) framework but your workload stores credit cards data unencrypted.

Your software developers and architects are unaware of the compliance framework that your organization must adhere to.

The yearly Systems and Organizations Control (SOC2) Type II audit is happening soon and you are unable to verify that controls are in place.

Benefits of establishing this best
    practice:

Evaluating and understanding the compliance requirements that apply to your workload will inform how you prioritize your efforts to deliver business value.

You choose the right locations and technologies that are congruent with your compliance framework."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/ops_priorities_compliance_reqs.html,"Designing your workload for auditability helps you to prove you are adhering to your compliance framework.

Level of risk exposed if this best practice
    is not established: High

Implementation guidance

Implementing this best practice means that you incorporate compliance requirements into your architecture design process. Your team members are aware of the required compliance framework. You validate compliance in line with the framework.

Customer example

AnyCompany Retail stores credit card information for customers. Developers on the card storage team understand that they need to comply with the PCI-DSS framework. They’ve taken steps to verify that credit card information is stored and accessed securely in line with the PCI-DSS framework. Every year they work with their security team to validate compliance.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/ops_priorities_compliance_reqs.html,"Implementation steps

Work with your security and governance teams to determine what industry, regulatory, or internal compliance frameworks that your workload must adhere to. Incorporate the compliance frameworks into your workload.
        
        
           
        
            
              Validate continual compliance of AWS resources with services like 
              AWS Compute Optimizer 
              and AWS Security Hub.

Educate your team members on the compliance requirements so they can operate and evolve the workload in line with them. Compliance requirements should be included in architectural and technological choices."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/ops_priorities_compliance_reqs.html,"Depending on the compliance framework, you may be required to generate an audit or compliance report. Work with your organization to automate this process as much as possible.
        
        
           
           
        
            
              Use services like AWS Audit Manager to generate validate compliance and generate audit reports.

    Framework emphasizes learning, measuring, and improving. It
    provides a consistent approach for you to evaluate architectures,
    and implement designs that will scale over time. AWS provides the
    AWS Well-Architected Tool to help you review your approach prior
    to development, the state of your workloads prior to production, and
    the state of your workloads in production. You can compare them to
    the latest AWS architectural best practices, monitor the overall
    status of your workloads, and gain insight to potential risks."

Manage benefits and risks to make informed decisions when
    determining where to focus efforts. For example, it may be
    beneficial to deploy a workload with unresolved issues so that
    significant new features can be made available to customers. It may
    be possible to mitigate associated risks, or it may become
    unacceptable to allow a risk to remain, in which case you will take
    action to address the risk.

You might find that you want to emphasize a small subset of your
    priorities at some point in time. Use a balanced approach over the
    long term to ensure the development of needed capabilities and
    management of risk. Update your priorities as needs change

OPS02-BP01 Resources have identified owners

PDF

RSS

Resources for your workload must have identified owners for change control, troubleshooting, and 
    other functions. Owners are assigned for workloads, accounts, infrastructure, platforms, and applications. 
    Ownership is recorded using tools like a central register or metadata attached to resources. The business 
    value of components informs the processes and procedures applied to them.

Desired outcome:

Resources have identified owners using metadata or a central register.

Team members can identify who owns resources.

Accounts have a single owner where possible.

Common anti-patterns:

The alternate contacts for your AWS accounts are not populated.

Resources lack tags that identify what teams own them.

You have an ITSM queue without an email mapping.

Two teams have overlapping ownership of a critical piece of infrastructure."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/ops_ops_model_def_resource_owners.html,"Benefits of establishing this best practice:

Change control for resources is straightforward with assigned ownership.

You can involve the right owners when troubleshooting issues.

Level of risk exposed if this best practice
    is not established: High

Implementation guidance

Define what ownership means for the resource use cases in your environment. 
      Ownership can mean who oversees changes to the resource, supports the resource 
      during troubleshooting, or who is financially accountable. Specify and record 
      owners for resources, including name, contact information, organization, and team.

Customer example"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/ops_ops_model_def_resource_owners.html,"Customer example

AnyCompany Retail defines ownership as the team or individual that owns changes and 
      support for resources. They leverage AWS Organizations to manage their AWS accounts. 
      Alternate account contacts are configuring using group inboxes. Each ITSM queue maps 
      to an email alias. Tags identify who own AWS resources. For other platforms and 
      infrastructure, they have a wiki page that identifies ownership and contact information.

Implementation steps

Start by defining ownership for your organization. Ownership can imply who owns 
          the risk for the resource, who owns changes to the resource, or who supports the 
          resource when troubleshooting. Ownership could also imply financial or administrative 
          ownership of the resource."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/ops_ops_model_def_resource_owners.html,"Use AWS Organizations to manage accounts. You can manage the alternate contacts for your accounts centrally. 
        
        
           
           
        
            
              Using company owned email addresses and phone numbers for contact information helps 
              you to access them even if the individuals whom they belong to are no longer with your 
              organization. For example, create separate email distribution lists for billing, 
              operations, and security and configure these as Billing, Security, and Operations 
              contacts in each active AWS account. Multiple people will receive AWS notifications 
              and be able to respond, even if someone is on vacation, changes roles, or leaves the company.
            
          
            
              If an account is not managed by AWS Organizations, alternate account contacts help AWS get in"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/ops_ops_model_def_resource_owners.html,"contact with the appropriate personnel if needed. Configure the account’s alternate 
              contacts to point to a group rather than an individual."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/ops_ops_model_def_resource_owners.html,"Use tags to identify owners for AWS resources. You can specify both owners and their contact information in separate tags. 
        
        
           
           
        
            
              You can use AWS Config rules to enforce that resources have the required ownership tags.
            
          
            
              For in-depth guidance on how to build a tagging strategy for your organization, see 
              AWS Tagging Best Practices whitepaper.

For other resources, platforms, and infrastructure, create documentation that identifies ownership. This should be accessible to all team members.

Level of effort for the implementation plan: Low. Leverage account 
      contact information and tags to assign ownership of AWS resources. For other resources you can use 
      something as simple as a table in a wiki to record ownership and contact information, or use an ITSM 
      tool to map ownership.

You can make requests to owners of processes, procedures, and resources. Requests 
    include additions, changes, and exceptions. These requests go through a change management 
    process. Make informed decisions to approve requests where viable and determined to be 
    appropriate after an evaluation of benefits and risks.

Desired outcome:

You can make requests to change processes, procedures, and resources based on assigned ownership.

Changes are made in a deliberate manner, weighing benefits and risks.

Common anti-patterns:

You must update the way you deploy your application, but there is no way to request a change to the deployment process from the operations team.

The disaster recovery plan must be updated, but there is no identified owner to request changes to.

Benefits of establishing this best practice:"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/ops_ops_model_req_add_chg_exception.html,"Processes, procedures, and resources can evolve as requirements change.

Have defined or negotiated agreements between teams describing how they work with 
    and support each other (for example, response times, service level objectives, or 
    service-level agreements). Inter-team communications channels are documented. 
    Understanding the impact of the teams’ work on business outcomes and the outcomes 
    of other teams and organizations informs the prioritization of their tasks and 
    helps them respond appropriately.

When responsibility and ownership are undefined or unknown, you are
    at risk of both not addressing necessary activities in a timely
    fashion and of redundant and potentially conflicting efforts
    emerging to address those needs.

Desired outcome:

Inter-team working or support agreements are agreed to and documented."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/ops_ops_model_def_neg_team_agreements.html,"Teams that support or work with each other have defined communication channels and response expectations.

Common anti-patterns:

An issue occurs in production and two separate teams start troubleshooting independent of each other. Their siloed efforts extend the outage.

The operations team needs assistance from the development team but there is no agreed to response time. The request is stuck in the backlog.

Benefits of establishing this best practice:

Teams know how to interact and support each other.

Expectations for responsiveness are known.

Communications channels are clearly defined.

Level of risk exposed if this best practice
    is not established: Low

Implementation guidance

Implementing this best practice means that there is no ambiguity about how teams work with each other. 
      Formal agreements codify how teams work together or support each other. Inter-team communication channels 
      are documented.

Customer example"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/ops_ops_model_def_neg_team_agreements.html,"Customer example

AnyCompany Retail’s SRE team has a service level agreement with their development team. Whenever 
      the development team makes a request in their ticketing system, they can expect a response within 
      fifteen minutes. If there is a site outage, the SRE team takes lead in the investigation with support 
      from the development team.

Implementation steps

Working with stakeholders across your organization, develop agreements between teams based on processes and procedures. 
        
        
           
           
        
            
              If a process or procedure is shared between two teams, develop a runbook on how the teams will work together.
            
          
            
              If there are dependencies between teams, agree to a response SLA for requests.

Team members have mechanisms and are encouraged to escalate concerns
    to decision makers and stakeholders if they believe outcomes are at

    can be identified, and prevented from causing incidents.

Level of risk exposed if this best practice

          acknowledge that escalation early and often is the best

PDF

RSS

Mechanisms exist and are used to provide timely notice to team
    members of known risks and planned events. Necessary context,
    details, and time (when possible) are provided to support
    determining if action is necessary, what action is required, and to
    take action in a timely manner.  For example, providing notice of 
    software vulnerabilities so that patching can be expedited, or 
    providing notice of planned sales promotions so that a change 
    freeze can be implemented to avoid the risk of service disruption. 
    Planned events can be recorded in a change calendar or maintenance 
    schedule so that team members can identify what activities are pending.

Desired outcome:

Communications provide context, details, and time expectations."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/ops_org_culture_effective_comms.html,"Team members have a clear understanding of when and how to act in response to communications.

Leverage change calendars to provide notice of expected changes.

Common anti-patterns:

An alert happens several times per week that is a false positive. You mute the notification 
        each time it happens.

You are asked to make a change to your security groups but are not given an expectation of 
        when it should happen.

You receive constant notifications in chat when systems scale up but no action is necessary. 
        You avoid the chat channel and miss an important notification.

A change is made to production without informing the operations team. The change creates an 
        alert and the on-call team is activated.

Benefits of establishing this best practice:

Your organization avoids alert fatigue.

Team members can act with the necessary context and expectations.

Changes can be made during change windows, reducing risk."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/ops_org_culture_effective_comms.html,"Level of risk exposed if this best practice

Implementation guidance

To implement this best practice, you must work with stakeholders across your 
      organization to agree to communication standards. Publicize those standards 
      to your organization. Identify and remove alerts that are false-positive or 
      always on. Utilize change calendars so team members know when actions can be 
      taken and what activities are pending. Verify that communications lead to 
      clear actions with necessary context.

Customer example

AnyCompany Retail uses chat as their main communication medium. Alerts and 
      other information populate specific channels. When someone must act, the 
      desired outcome is clearly stated, and in many cases, they are given a 
      runbook or playbook to use. They use a change calendar to schedule major 
      changes to production systems.

Implementation steps"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/ops_org_culture_effective_comms.html,"Implementation steps

Analyze your alerts for false-positives or alerts that are constantly 
          created. Remove or change them so that they start when human intervention 
          is required. If an alert is initiated, provide a runbook or playbook.
        
        
           
        
            
              You can use AWS Systems Manager Documents to build playbooks and runbooks for alerts.

2Mechanisms are in place to provide notification of risks or planned events in a 
          clear and actionable way with enough notice to allow appropriate responses. Use 
          email lists or chat channels to send notifications ahead of planned events.

OPS03-BP05 Experimentation is encouraged

RSS

Experimentation is a catalyst for turning new ideas into products and features. It accelerates learning and keeps team members interested and engaged. Team members are encouraged to experiment often to drive innovation. Even when an undesired result occurs, there is value in knowing what not to do. Team members are not punished for successful experiments with undesired results.

Desired outcome:

Your organization encourages experimentation to foster innovation.

Experiments are used as an opportunity to learn.

Common anti-patterns:

You want to run an A/B test but there is no mechanism to run the experiment. You deploy a UI change without the ability to test it. It results in a negative customer experience."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/ops_org_culture_team_enc_experiment.html,"Your company only has a stage and production environment. There is no sandbox environment to experiment with new features or products so you must experiment within the production environment.

Benefits of establishing this best practice:

Experimentation drives innovation.

You can react faster to feedback from users through experimentation.

Your organization develops a culture of learning.

Level of risk exposed if this best practice
    is not established: Medium

Implementation guidance

Experiments should be run in a safe manner. Leverage multiple environments to experiment without jeopardizing production resources. Use A/B testing and feature flags to test experiments. Provide team members the ability to conduct experiments in a sandbox environment.
