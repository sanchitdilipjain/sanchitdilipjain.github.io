&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Introduction&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>AWS Budgets provides a feature to handle cost and utilization by providing notifications when cost or usage is beyond the configured threshold. It can only be used as a mechanism to notify the usage and not a medium to restrict the actions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Budgets and notifications are directly dependent on your billing data and it is updated at least once a day&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;strong>NOTE:&lt;/strong> You may not receive an alarm for a forecasted budget if your account is new. Forecasting requires existing usage within the account.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>What is Amazon EKS?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Amazon EKS (Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes) is a managed Kubernetes service that allows you to run Kubernetes on AWS without the hassle of managing the Kubernetes control plane. The Kubernetes control plane plays a crucial role in a Kubernetes deployment as it is responsible for how Kubernetes communicates with your cluster&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The big benefit of EKS, and other similar hosted Kubernetes services, is taking away the operational burden involved in running this control plane. You deploy cluster worker nodes using defined AMIs and with the help of CloudFormation, and EKS will provision, scale and manage the Kubernetes control plane for you to ensure high availability, security and scalability.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
