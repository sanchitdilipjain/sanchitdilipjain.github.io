&lt;p>&lt;strong>Introduction&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, Generative AI (GenAI) stands out as a transformative force across various industries. Its ability to create original content—be it text, images, or even music—has the potential to redefine how businesses operate and innovate.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>However, the true power of GenAI is unlocked only when it is fed with high-quality, diverse, and accessible data. This is where a modern data strategy becomes essential.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data is often likened to &amp;ldquo;new oil&amp;rdquo;; like oil, it requires refinement and processing to yield value. A modern data strategy acts as the critical fuel for this process, enabling organizations to not only collect data but also transform it into a valuable asset that can be efficiently harnessed for AI innovation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This holistic approach encompasses data ingestion, storage, processing, governance, and analysis, ensuring that data is not only accessible but also reliable and secure for AI consumption.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Understanding the correlation between data and GenAI is vital. The performance and capabilities of GenAI models are directly influenced by the quality, quantity, and diversity of the data they learn from.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Therefore, organizations must prioritize a robust data strategy to fully leverage the potential of Generative AI, making it a cornerstone of their digital transformation journey.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>What is Data Governance?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Data governance is the practice of managing data to ensure its availability, usability, integrity, and security within an organization. According to Gartner, by 2025, 80% of organizations seeking to scale digital businesses will fail because they do not take a modern approach to data and analytics governance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data governance involves a set of processes, roles, policies, standards, and metrics that ensure the effective and efficient use of information to enable an organization to achieve its goals.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
