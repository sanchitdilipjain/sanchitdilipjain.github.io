EventBridge bridges your application based on events. You can plug your own AWS platform with REST API, any SaaS applications, and custom apps as event sources that publish events to an event bus. You can state a filtering rule to refine events and target events to different services and REST endpoint destinations. EventBridge reduces the process of constructing an event-driven platform. EventBridge, decouple the destination from the source of the event, and this way you can refine and notify directly to EventBridge.</description></item></channel></rss>
