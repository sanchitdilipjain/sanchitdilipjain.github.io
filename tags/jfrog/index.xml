&lt;p>&lt;strong>Overview&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When managing data pipelines and workflows in AWS Managed Apache Airflow, it&amp;rsquo;s often necessary to integrate with various external services for tasks such as downloading binaries, libraries, or other dependencies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>JFrog Artifactory is a popular binary repository manager that allows you to securely store and manage artifacts. Integrating JFrog with AWS Managed Apache Airflow enables seamless and secure downloading of these artifacts, ensuring that your workflows can reliably access the necessary resources.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This integration is crucial for maintaining consistency and security across your deployment pipelines, allowing you to automate complex workflows without manual intervention.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By using AWS Secrets Manager and a startup script, we can securely manage the credentials required for this integration, ensuring that sensitive information is handled safely.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
