What is Amazon Redshift?
Amazon Redshift is a fast, fully managed, petabyte-scale cloud-based data warehouse service. It makes it simple and cost-effective to efficiently run your analytics workloads at scale. Amazon Redshift uses columnar storage (also known as columnstore) to store your data in columns instead of rows, which allows it to make more efficient use of storage space and compute resources than traditional row-oriented databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL.</description></item><item><title>Orchestration Amazon EMR Serverless using MWAA‚è∞</title><link>https://sanchitdilipjain.github.io/post/orchestration-emr-serverless-mwaa/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sanchitdilipjain.github.io/post/orchestration-emr-serverless-mwaa/</guid><description>Orchestration Amazon EMR Serverless using Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) Introduction
