What is Amazon Redshift?
Amazon Redshift is a fast, fully managed, petabyte-scale cloud-based data warehouse service. It makes it simple and cost-effective to efficiently run your analytics workloads at scale.

What is Amazon EMR?
Amazon EMR is a cloud big data platform running large-scale distributed data processing jobs, interactive SQL queries, and machine learning (ML) applications using open-source analytics frameworks such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, and Presto. Understanding clusters and nodes A cluster is a collection of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. An instance in the cluster is called a node, and each node has role within the cluster, referred to as the node type.</description></item><item><title>Amazon EMR Serverless - RDS Hive MetaStore Integration üß¨</title><link>https://sanchitdilipjain.github.io/post/amazon-emr-serverless-hive-metastore/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sanchitdilipjain.github.io/post/amazon-emr-serverless-hive-metastore/</guid><description>Amazon EMR Serverless - RDS Hive MetaStore Integration Introduction
