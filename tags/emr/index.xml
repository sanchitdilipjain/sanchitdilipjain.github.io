Amazon EMR on EKS provides a deployment option for Amazon EMR that allows you to run open-source big data frameworks on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS).
With this deployment option, you can focus on running analytics workloads while Amazon EMR on EKS builds, configures, and manages containers for open-source applications.
The following diagram shows the two different deployment models for Amazon EMR.</description></item><item><title>How do you run Flink job with Amazon EMR on Amazon EKS?üí°</title><link>https://sanchitdilipjain.github.io/post/amazon-emr-on-eks-flink/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Dec 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sanchitdilipjain.github.io/post/amazon-emr-on-eks-flink/</guid><description>How do you run Flink jobs with Amazon EMR on Amazon EKS?üí° Introduction

What is Amazon EMR?
Amazon EMR is a cloud big data platform running large-scale distributed data processing jobs, interactive SQL queries, and machine learning (ML) applications using open-source analytics frameworks such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, and Presto. Understanding clusters and nodes A cluster is a collection of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. An instance in the cluster is called a node, and each node has role within the cluster, referred to as the node type.</description></item><item><title>Amazon EMR Serverless - RDS Hive MetaStore Integration ‚öíÔ∏è</title><link>https://sanchitdilipjain.github.io/post/amazon-emr-serverless-hive-metastore/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sanchitdilipjain.github.io/post/amazon-emr-serverless-hive-metastore/</guid><description>Amazon EMR Serverless - RDS Hive MetaStore Integration Introduction
