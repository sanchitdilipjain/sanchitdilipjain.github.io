&lt;p>&lt;strong>Introduction&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>AWS App Runner is a service that offers a fast, simple, and cost-effective method to deploy a Github repository or a docker image as a web application in the AWS Cloud, and offers direct integration and delivery pipeline with fully managed operations, high performance, scalability, and security.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Out of the box, App Runner is built for the desired scale, so there is no requirement to re-platform or re-architect as the business grows and makes it simpler to rapidly deliver innovative solutions and business value, regardless of the language they are written in, even for teams that lack prior experience deploying and managing containers or infrastructure&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
