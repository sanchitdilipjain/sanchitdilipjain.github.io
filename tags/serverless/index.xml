Amazon Redshift ML makes it easy for data analysts and database developers to create, train, and apply machine learning models using familiar SQL commands in Amazon Redshift data warehouses.
With Redshift ML, you can take advantage of Amazon SageMaker, a fully managed machine learning service, without learning new tools or languages. Simply use SQL statements to create and train Amazon SageMaker machine learning models using your Redshift data and then use these models to make predictions.</description></item><item><title>Orchestration Amazon EMR Serverless using MWAA‚è∞</title><link>https://sanchitdilipjain.github.io/post/orchestration-emr-serverless-mwaa/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sanchitdilipjain.github.io/post/orchestration-emr-serverless-mwaa/</guid><description>Orchestration Amazon EMR Serverless using Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) Introduction
What is Amazon EMR?
Amazon EMR is a cloud big data platform running large-scale distributed data processing jobs, interactive SQL queries, and machine learning (ML) applications using open-source analytics frameworks such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, and Presto. Understanding clusters and nodes A cluster is a collection of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. An instance in the cluster is called a node, and each node has role within the cluster, referred to as the node type.</description></item><item><title>Amazon EMR Serverless - RDS Hive MetaStore Integration ‚öíÔ∏è</title><link>https://sanchitdilipjain.github.io/post/amazon-emr-serverless-hive-metastore/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sanchitdilipjain.github.io/post/amazon-emr-serverless-hive-metastore/</guid><description>Amazon EMR Serverless - RDS Hive MetaStore Integration Introduction

Overview
AWS User Group Nashik-Mumbai-Pune is excited to announce our finale session as part of Serverless, No server, Really? series.
This session will explore other lesser-known serverless services that can help leverage the true power of serverless like Fargate, the difference between EC2 Fargate and Lambda, an overview of SAM, AWS Step Functions, AWS AppSync, Amazon EventBridge, Aurora Serverless, RDS Proxy, and much more.
Speakers.
