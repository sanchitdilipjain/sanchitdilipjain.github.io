By default, an Amazon SNS topic subscriber receives every message published to the topic. To receive a subset of the messages, a subscriber must assign a filter policy to the topic subscription. A filter policy is a simple JSON object containing attributes that define which messages the subscriber receives.
When you publish a message to a topic, Amazon SNS compares the message attributes to the attributes in the filter policy for each of the topic‚Äôs subscriptions.</description></item><item><title>Explore managed Kubernetes offering from AWS (AWS EKS)üöÄ</title><link>https://sanchitdilipjain.github.io/post/aws-eks-introduction/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Aug 2020 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sanchitdilipjain.github.io/post/aws-eks-introduction/</guid><description>Introduction to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service What is Amazon EKS?
